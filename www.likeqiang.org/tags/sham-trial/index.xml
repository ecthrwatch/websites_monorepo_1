      <description>The events surrounding the civil litigation, an authentic sham trial, which happened from 2006 to 2008, have been extremely distressing, and I wish to highlight several crucial aspects.

Please note that the first communication I submitted to the Court has been heavily redacted and the Court&amp;rsquo;s records pertaining to this case have been sealed due to the extreme sensitiveness of some information.</description>
