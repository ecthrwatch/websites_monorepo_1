  content="Who am I? On February 16, 2023, I received formal notification from the European Court of Human Rights that my request for anonymity (under Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court) was accepted. However, in August 2023, due to concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, I made the difficult decision to temporarily go public with my identity.
My efforts to alert the FBI about the activities of McDonald’s Corporation began in earnest in 2015 and intensified from September 2021, with a significant increase in these efforts starting in September 2022.">

        I am the key witness and whistleblower in the major criminal RICO case targeting McDonald’s Corporation and their accomplices for fraud, money laundering, and corruption of foreign officials and magistrates. Initially granted anonymity by the European Court of Human Rights (Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court), I made the decision in August 2023 to temporarily go public with my identity. This decision, driven by concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, was taken despite the potential risks, hoping it will be temporary only and that I can return to anonymity soon.

<p>On February 16, 2023, I received formal notification from the European Court of Human Rights that my request for anonymity (under Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court) was accepted. However, in August 2023, due to concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, I made the difficult decision to temporarily go public with my identity.</p>
<p>My efforts to alert the FBI about the activities of McDonald’s Corporation began in earnest in 2015 and intensified from September 2021, with a significant increase in these efforts starting in September 2022. I am actively communicating with American authorities, and some of these communications addressed to the FBI are publicly available on <a href="https://www.federal-bureau-of-investigation.com/open-letters/">Federal-Bureau-of-Investigation.com/open-letters/</a>, a <em>non-official</em> website on the FBI that I created for transparency in this significant crime case.</p>
<p>McDonald’s Corporation has perpetrated one of the largest frauds in history, involving multiple instances of mass-marketing fraud across various nations. This has given McDonald&rsquo;s and its accomplices an unfair financial advantage over competitors, enabling them to reach their current colossal size. A concise timeline of these events is available at <a href="https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/mcdonalds/">https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/mcdonalds/</a>.</p>
<p>The absence of a judicial response from the French authorities raises serious concerns. It suggests either a dangerous level of incompetence or potential corruption within their ranks. In his book &ldquo;I Sold My Soul to McDonald&rsquo;s,&rdquo; former McDonald&rsquo;s France CEO Jean-Pierre Petit seemingly boasts about the company&rsquo;s influence over politicians, highlighting the gravity of the situation.</p>

In this email, I alerted them to the serious dysfunctions of the French judicial system. I also provided 7 concrete examples of the serious crime of falsification/doctoring/altering/forging of a court/public/official/legal document/decision, under articles 441-1 and 441-4 of the French criminal code. I alerted them that there are at least several billion euros in fines to be imposed on the McDonald&#39;s group.

    <h3 class="mt-0">French Minister of Justice Nicole Belloubet formally notified of forgery and use of forged documents at the Versailles Court</h3>
  </a>
  
    On October 23, 2018, at 20:06, I formally notified French Minister of Justice Nicole Belloubet about the grave incident at the Legal Aid Office of the Versailles Court. This office had intentionally altered a date to unjustly dismiss my appeal against McDonald&#39;s France and one of their accomplices, thus committing a serious crime under French law. Minister Belloubet might also have committed a crime if she neglected to follow-up on my report.

    On October 23, 2018, at 19:34, I alerted high-ranking French magistrates, encompassing both public prosecutors and judges, about a grave incident at the Legal Aid Office of the Versailles Court.

    Email from Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, confirming to me that procedural contracts are invented by the bar associations, the jurisdictions, and the legal aid offices, and that this is something truly preposterous! That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it. In essence, this situation amounts to the judicial branch circumventing the legislative branch to create its own laws, a practice that is profoundly dangerous. It undermines the principle of the separation of powers, a cornerstone of democratic governance.
