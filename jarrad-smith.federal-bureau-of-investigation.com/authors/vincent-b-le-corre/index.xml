Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2023-12-21-1800-0100-happy-birthday-mr-president.pdf Mr. President,
Exactly five years ago to the day, on December 21, 2018, I registered the domain name Macron-Emmanuel.com to launch an unofficial website about you, Mr. President.
My intention has always been benevolent. As I have done for other high-level officials and magistrates such as Nicole Belloubet, Cédric Villani, or François Molins, my aim was to raise public awareness not only of the serious crimes committed by the transnational criminal entity McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation but also to highlight the recurring pattern of crimes of forgery and use of forged documents within the French judicial system.</description>

Dear Mr. Don Alway, thank you for sharing the message of Director Wray. I watched it with genuine interest. I sincerely hope the FBI doesn’t underestimate the harm done by white-collar criminals. Director Wray omitted to mention financial crime but financial crimes often end up causing very significant harm to society including lots of premature deaths.</description>

Dear Mr. Kempczinski,
Is Mr. Ozan’s departure related to the criminal RICO case targeting McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation and if yes, to which extent is it related? (look at the screenshot 👇 to understand)
You also mention Mr. Ozan’s “unwavering integrity,” could you please confirm he reported internally my stern warnings about the crimes McDonald’s is engaging into?
As the CFO, he obviously should have understood McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation is engaging in money laundering, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he?</description>

      <description>On February 15, 2023, I tried to call a phone number I found on an FBI brochure related to the FBI Victim Services. The phone number was (202)-324-3000.
But the FBI operator hanged up on me.
After the FBI informed me the FBI was recording the phone call, I informed the operator that I was also recording the phone call and he disagreed so he hanged up.

Key point: French law professor Yves Strickler didn&amp;rsquo;t disapprove the possibility for me to do a hunger strike to protest the repeated violations of my fundamental rights by France. For the record, I am now accusing McDonald’s of having corrupted French officials. It might help to explain why McDonald’s France and McDonald’s Corporation, and their accomplices, have never been indicted for serious fraud and money laundering in France.</description>

      <description>On December 17, 2015, I contacted the Washington D.C. FBI Field Office at +1-202-278-2000 to report the crimes committed by McDonald’s Corporation and their accomplices. The conversation lasted approximately 6 minutes and 35 seconds. Upon disclosing my location in China to the phone operator/intake agent, I was informed that the FBI could not take action as they lacked jurisdiction in China. However, this response seems to overlook the extraterritorial application of many American laws, suggesting a potential oversight in handling my report.</description>

I know you know this “game” is a fraud under European laws. You can not possibly be so stupid not to understand except if you don’t understand on purpose so that you can later claim plausible deniability.</description>

On October 27, 2015, I received an email from McDonald’s France lawyer Éric Andrieu of the Péchenard &amp;amp; Associés law firm.

The lawyer commits an exceptionally serious mistake (legal malpractice) by confirming “to [his] clients that the sweepstakes [note: actually a serious fraud] was in compliance with French and European law.” This is obviously false. Either he is dangerously incompetent, or he is complicit.</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

Ms. Santona,
First of all, I want to thank you for having taken my phone call today without hanging up on me right away. Your counter-part in France, Mme de Borda, always refused to communicate with me through phone.</description>

      <description>This book contains a crucial evidence that McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation executives could have easily, through a simple phone call, stop the ongoing frauds which were happening in France, and later in Europe.
Then, why didn&amp;rsquo;t they?
In addition to the fact that there is an undeniable proof that, contrarily to what Gloria Santona said, this was a French problem, the book offers additional insights about how McDonald&amp;rsquo;s seems to corrupt politicians.
To gain a clearer understanding of the sequence of events in this case, I invite you to view a detailed timeline at the following link:</description>

&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, a copy of the mail was sent to a French Ministerial Officer who I now accuse of being corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation coming soon. (Note of 2023-04-13: quick note, this event happened in 2012 and I published it, if I am not mistaken, on 2022-09-21T20:49:00+08:00. Back then I wrote “translation coming soon” but I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have time to translate what was said in French. It&amp;rsquo;s an important event but not that important compared to what I am currently explaining to the FBI which is the priority.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Françoise de Borda, directrice juridique de McDonald’s France, me réponds pour la première et pour la dernière fois. Elle ment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Around January 2023, I found out that McDonald’s Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald’s Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald’s Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.
