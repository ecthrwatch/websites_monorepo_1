Dear Mr. Don Alway, thank you for sharing the message of Director Wray. I watched it with genuine interest. I sincerely hope the FBI doesn’t underestimate the harm done by white-collar criminals. Director Wray omitted to mention financial crime but financial crimes often end up causing very significant harm to society including lots of premature deaths.</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>
