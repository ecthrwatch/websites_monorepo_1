Dear Mr. Kempczinski,
Is Mr. Ozan‚Äôs departure related to the criminal RICO case targeting McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation and if yes, to which extent is it related? (look at the screenshot üëá to understand)
You also mention Mr. Ozan‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering integrity,‚Äù could you please confirm he reported internally my stern warnings about the crimes McDonald‚Äôs is engaging into?
As the CFO, he obviously should have understood McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation is engaging in money laundering, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he?</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald‚Äôs Corporation executives ‚Äútake such inquiries seriously‚Äù, McDonald‚Äôs Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald‚Äôs Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald‚Äôs Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald‚Äôs a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I‚Äôve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012.</description>

Ms. Santona,
First of all, I want to thank you for having taken my phone call today without hanging up on me right away. Your counter-part in France, Mme de Borda, always refused to communicate with me through phone.</description>

      <description>Around January 2023, I found out that McDonald‚Äôs Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald‚Äôs Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald‚Äôs Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.
