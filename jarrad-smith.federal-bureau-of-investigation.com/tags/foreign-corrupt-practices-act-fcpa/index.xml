      <description>In the fall of 2013, Jean-Pierre Petit, who was then the CEO of McDonald’s France, authored a revealing book titled I Sold My Soul to McDonald’s. The title itself, a nod to the notorious phrase about making a pact with the devil, is quite revealing.
The book turns out to be a crucial piece of evidence in the criminal RICO case targeting McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices, especially in light of my direct alerts to the top executives at McDonald’s Corporation in 2015 about ongoing criminal activities by its subsidiary companies in Europe.</description>

      <description>On May 30, 2013, I sent a formal notice through 6 certified mails with proof of receipt requested and delivered to McDonald’s France and the (corrupted) French Ministerial Office Henri-Antoine Le Honsec. I issued a stern rebuke against the deceptive practices endorsed by this French Ministerial Officer (called in France an huissier de justice: without his approval, the fraudulent sweepstakes could never have taken place). This notice served as a prelude to formal legal action, explicitly invoking the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).</description>
