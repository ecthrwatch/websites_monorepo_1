Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

      <description>Around January 2023, I found out that McDonald’s Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald’s Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald’s Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.
