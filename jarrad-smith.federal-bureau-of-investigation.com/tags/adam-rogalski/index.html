I argue that their statement of “1 chance out of 4” to win instantly must logically refer to each individual game stamp as an attempt, not a set of stamps. By leveraging the axiom of extension from set theory, I demonstrate that the differing number of game stamps offered with various menu options necessitates this interpretation of attempts.

I contemplate the temptation for McDonald’s to cross legal boundaries for profit, especially given their daily interaction with 60 million consumers worldwide. The prospect of gaining just an additional quarter per customer translates to substantial annual revenue, underscoring the possible motivations behind their fraudulent activities, including the McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes. I hint at ongoing serious infractions by McDonald’s France that could greatly influence the market and competition. My focus remains on the Monopoly sweepstakes frauds, with an urgent call to consider a RICO indictment against McDonald’s.

I emphasize the critical difference between the number of instant-win elements and total sets, a distinction that dramatically affects the perceived odds of winning. My analysis reveals that the actual chance of securing a prize is closer to 1 in 8, not the widely marketed 1 in 4. This significant disparity points to a mass-marketing fraud campaign by a major corporation, one that even children are expected to navigate.

This distinction is vital in dissecting the fraudulent activities of McDonald’s in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I reference a flawed article by journalist Walter Hickey to illustrate common misconceptions, while also highlighting the accurate definition of probability as given by David Morin from Harvard University. My expectation is that FBI and Justice Department agents not only grasp the fundamental concept of probability, but also recognize the impact of the number of trials in a Binomial distribution on the outcome.

My goal is to demonstrate the fraud in their probability claims and to clarify the real chances of winning based on a single game stamp. I urge Mr. Rogalski (State Department/FBI) to ensure the FBI is aware of these issues, as they have ramifications in numerous countries. I urge the FBI to alert INTERPOL.

Citing a detailed explanation on a website, I argue that the promotion’s claim of “NO PURCHASE NECESSARY” is misleading, as statistical analysis suggests that participating without a purchase might be more costly than the prizes offered. Additionally, I challenge the assertion that “PURCHASE WILL NOT IMPROVE CHANCES OF WINNING.” I propose that, theoretically, a wealthy enough individual could secure all prizes by purchasing all game stamps, thereby guaranteeing victory, which contradicts McDonald’s claim. These inconsistencies, I believe, point towards fraudulent practices. I also suggest the FBI question former McDonald’s executive Gloria Santona, as her departure timing might be significant.

  </a>
  
    In one of my analysis, I uncover the truth behind McDonald’s “1 in 4” odds in their Monopoly sweepstakes. Through a binomial distribution approach, I demonstrate the vast disparity between the claimed and actual probabilities of winning, with real odds ranging from 1 in 1,000 to a staggering 1 in 10 billion. This investigation highlights a systematic pattern of mass-marketing fraud within McDonald’s promotions. I call for immediate action from the U.S. Department of Justice to address these criminal practices that significantly skew market competition and defraud consumers worldwide.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my correspondence with the FBI, I elucidate the critical distinctions between simple probability and binomial distribution probability, highlighting the substantial implications these differences have in the context of this mass-marketing fraud case affecting many countries around the world. I argue that without explicit clarification, consumers, including minors, were inevitably defrauded by the criminal practices of the corporate predator that McDonald’s Corporation is. This fraudulent misrepresentation of chances of winning as simple probability, when they are in fact outcomes of a complex binomial probability, underscores my appeal for witness protection in the face of such powerful entities operating akin to a crime syndicate.<br>

    In my email to Messrs. Manjarrez and Rogalski, I express my challenges in submitting a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI due to citizenship verification issues. I question the apparent barriers faced by foreigners in accessing information under the Privacy Act of 1974. This frustration is compounded by my concern over the lack of response from the SEC since November 2022. I emphasize the importance of transparency in my case, which involves allegations against McDonald’s Corporation and a criminal complaint filed by the former French Minister of Justice. I highlight my previous attempts to alert the FBI in 2015 and my recent efforts to reach out again after learning of the complaint against me. My request seeks all information the FBI may have about me and my case. This email underscores my persistent pursuit of clarity and my rights as a victim in an international legal context.<br>

    In my email to Mr. Adam Rogalski at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, I stress the importance of notifying the Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit about McDonald’s Corporation’s misconduct. I reference the unit’s collaboration with regulatory partners like the SEC, emphasizing a similar approach I suggested to the FBI in 2015. My correspondence includes links to a transcript and a YouTube video of a previous call with the FBI, where I discussed the potential for joint investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. I argue for a coordinated effort between the SEC and FBI to investigate McDonald’s, underscoring the gravity of the situation. This email reflects my persistent efforts to seek justice and accountability in a case with significant legal and economic implications.<br>

I share my ongoing research efforts and draw parallels between McDonald’s alleged activities and those of known fraudster Lance Armstrong, to illustrate the potential scale of deceit. My plea for transparency and information—specifically regarding the lead agent, case number, and FBI Victim Specialist—is a clear call for updates and support as I navigate through the intertwining legal and financial ramifications that this case presents.<br>

By leveraging the axiom of extension from set theory, I demonstrate that the differing number of game stamps offered with various menu options necessitates this interpretation of attempts. My email is a crucial clarification for the investigation, highlighting McDonald’s lack of transparency and the need for the FBI to recognize the underlying deceit in their criminal practices.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">60 Million Consumers: Addressing the Scale of McDonald’s Frauds</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my communication with the FBI, I discuss the immense scale of McDonald’s global consumer base, highlighting the potential for significant financial impact from even minor price manipulations. I contemplate the temptation for McDonald’s to cross legal boundaries for profit, especially given their daily interaction with 60 million consumers worldwide. The prospect of gaining just an additional quarter per customer translates to substantial annual revenue, underscoring the possible motivations behind their fraudulent activities, including the McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes. I hint at ongoing serious infractions by McDonald’s France that could greatly influence the market and competition. My focus remains on the Monopoly sweepstakes frauds, with an urgent call to consider a RICO indictment against McDonald’s. This email aims to shed light on the magnitude of potential corporate wrongdoing and the need for decisive legal action.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my communication with the FBI, I dissect a Business Insider article to clarify the misconceptions surrounding McDonald’s Monopoly promotion probabilities. I emphasize the critical difference between the number of instant-win elements and total sets, a distinction that dramatically affects the perceived odds of winning. My analysis reveals that the actual chance of securing a prize is closer to 1 in 8, not the widely marketed 1 in 4. This significant disparity points to a mass-marketing fraud campaign by a major corporation, one that even children are expected to navigate. I urge for this nuanced understanding of odds calculation to be recognized and corrected, highlighting the intricate fraudulence at play and the need for meticulous scrutiny.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Clarifying Probability Concepts for the FBI Investigation : the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my recent email to the FBI, I stress the importance of understanding key probability concepts—specifically, the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions. This distinction is vital in dissecting the fraudulent activities of McDonald’s in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I reference a flawed article by journalist Walter Hickey to illustrate common misconceptions, while also highlighting the accurate definition of probability as given by David Morin from Harvard University. My expectation is that FBI and Justice Department agents not only grasp the fundamental concept of probability, but also recognize the impact of the number of trials in a Binomial distribution on the outcome. This understanding is crucial for unraveling the complexities of the case at hand.<br>

I express urgency for the FBI and the Justice Department to grasp the nuanced distinction between an element and a set, a foundational concept that underpins the sophisticated mechanics of the crimes in question. Amidst my call for clarity and action, I also convey my anticipation for a response regarding the lead investigator of the racketeering case, hinting at the necessity to involve oversight agencies should the silence persist. My message underscores the critical need for understanding mathematical principles in unraveling the intricacies of the serious crimes committed by the transnational crimal entity McDonald’s Corporation.<br>

I argue that, in reality, the odds were closer to “1 chance out of 8,” a figure never stated by the corporation. My goal is to demonstrate the fraud in their probability claims and to clarify the real chances of winning based on a single game stamp. I urge Mr. Rogalski (State Department/FBI) to ensure the FBI is aware of these issues, as they have ramifications in numerous countries. I urge the FBI to alert INTERPOL. This email is an attempt to unravel the complexities of the situation, seeking clarity and accountability in one of the largest fraud cases in history.<br>

Citing a detailed explanation on a website, I argue that the promotion’s claim of “NO PURCHASE NECESSARY” is misleading, as statistical analysis suggests that participating without a purchase might be more costly than the prizes offered. Additionally, I challenge the assertion that “PURCHASE WILL NOT IMPROVE CHANCES OF WINNING.” I propose that, theoretically, a wealthy enough individual could secure all prizes by purchasing all game stamps, thereby guaranteeing victory, which contradicts McDonald’s claim. These inconsistencies, I believe, point towards fraudulent practices. I also suggest the FBI question former McDonald’s executive Gloria Santona, as her departure timing might be significant. My aim is to highlight the potential deception in this widely known sweepstakes and the need for thorough investigation.<br>

    I reach out with a personal appeal to the FBI and State Department, requesting clear communication and support in a complex fraud case. Amid the turmoil of being a key witness against a formidable corporate adversary, I convey my struggle for peace and the heavy toll of ongoing stress. I emphasize my need for confidentiality in certain discussions, along with psychological support, underscoring the gravity of the situation and my earnest quest for assistance and understanding from law enforcement.<br>
