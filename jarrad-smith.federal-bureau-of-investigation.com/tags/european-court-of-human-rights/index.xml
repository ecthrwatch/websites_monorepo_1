      <description>First fax sent to the ECtHR on December 15, 2023 The first fax I sent, on December 15, 2023, to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has been heavily redacted but can nevertheless be viewed here: A_1_Binder1_submitted_by_fax_2023-12-15_Redacted.pdf
The only thing the general public can view is that “In compliance with [REDACTED] I am asking the Court to keep this request for interim measures and related documents off public record.”
Based on a phone conversation I had with an employee of the ECtHR, the Court accepted to seal the records pertaining to this case.</description>
