Dear Mr. Don Alway, thank you for sharing the message of Director Wray. I watched it with genuine interest. I sincerely hope the FBI doesn‚Äôt underestimate the harm done by white-collar criminals. Director Wray omitted to mention financial crime but financial crimes often end up causing very significant harm to society including lots of premature deaths.</description>

Dear Mr. Kempczinski,
Is Mr. Ozan‚Äôs departure related to the criminal RICO case targeting McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation and if yes, to which extent is it related? (look at the screenshot üëá to understand)
You also mention Mr. Ozan‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering integrity,‚Äù could you please confirm he reported internally my stern warnings about the crimes McDonald‚Äôs is engaging into?
As the CFO, he obviously should have understood McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation is engaging in money laundering, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he?</description>

      <description>On February 15, 2023, I tried to call a phone number I found on an FBI brochure related to the FBI Victim Services. The phone number was (202)-324-3000.
But the FBI operator hanged up on me.
After the FBI informed me the FBI was recording the phone call, I informed the operator that I was also recording the phone call and he disagreed so he hanged up.
To gain a clearer understanding of the sequence of events in this case, I invite you to view a detailed timeline at the following link:</description>
