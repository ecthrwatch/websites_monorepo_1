Dear Ms. Ralls-Morrison,
I recently came across a LinkedIn post announcing your upcoming receipt of the CCWC 2024 Diamond Award of Excellence in Las Vegas at the Bellagio, as quoted by Ms. Laurie N. Robinson Haden.

Dear Mr. Don Alway, thank you for sharing the message of Director Wray. I watched it with genuine interest. I sincerely hope the FBI doesn‚Äôt underestimate the harm done by white-collar criminals. Director Wray omitted to mention financial crime but financial crimes often end up causing very significant harm to society including lots of premature deaths.</description>

Dear Mr. Kempczinski,
Is Mr. Ozan‚Äôs departure related to the criminal RICO case targeting McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation and if yes, to which extent is it related? (look at the screenshot üëá to understand)
You also mention Mr. Ozan‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering integrity,‚Äù could you please confirm he reported internally my stern warnings about the crimes McDonald‚Äôs is engaging into?
As the CFO, he obviously should have understood McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation is engaging in money laundering, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he?</description>

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald‚Äôs a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I‚Äôve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

      <description>Around January 2023, I found out that McDonald‚Äôs Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald‚Äôs Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald‚Äôs Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.
