<p>His Excellency Bertrand Lortholary<br>
Ambassador of France to China<br>
Embassy of the Republic of France<br>
60 Tianze Rd., Chaoyang District,<br>
Beijing 100600<br>
China</p>
<p>Dear Ambassador Lortholary,</p>
<p>I reach out to you today understanding fully the demands on your time; however, I must stress the urgency and gravity of the situation I present, which pertains to the economic security of our nation, France.</p>
<p>The legal operation of foreign entities within our borders is indeed a cornerstone of our international trade agreements. Yet, when such entities deviate into the realm of illegality, particularly when orchestrated by a criminal enterprise, the long-term repercussions to our national economy and to the integrity of our financial systems are both severe and unacceptable.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence, as we <em>might</em> be on the cusp of critical legal deadlines. The statute of limitations for the frauds committed in 2011 <em>might</em> perilously be close to expiring on November 14, 2023, at 23:59, while the statute for the 2017 infractions <em>might</em> be set to lapse imminently, on November 10, 2023, also at 23:59.</p>
<p>To grasp the full scope of the 2017 frauds, one must consider the context established by the events of 2016. Within the enclosed draft report submitted to the FBI, from paragraph (183) to (234), I have meticulously documented the fraudulent conduct of McDonald’s France and their accomplices, which, evidence suggests, received tacit approval from McDonald’s Corporation&rsquo;s higher echelons.</p>
<p>Notably, in 2015, the then-General Counsel Gloria Santona acknowledged the gravity of the issues I raised in 2015, with then-CEO Steve Easterbrook being directly CCed on the correspondence.</p>
<p>The testimony of McDonald’s France employee Ms. Orane El&rsquo;Khass, particularly highlighted in paragraphs (218) and (222), provides damning evidence of the internal complicity in these fraudulent schemes. <strong>If McDonald’s Corporation previously pursued legal action under RICO statutes highlighted in paragraphs (140) to (142), the question arises as to why they have not done the same with McDonald</strong>**’s France, their franchisees, and their employees.**</p>
<p>The 2017 frauds, elucidated from paragraph (416) to paragraph (446), are laid bare with an irrefutable mathematical analysis, which exposes the impossibility for consumers to obtain the promised rewards and confirms the testimonies like that of Ms. El&rsquo;Khass that the sweepstakes were, in essence, rigged by McDonald’s own employees—deceiving millions and enriching the corporation at the cost of public trust.</p>
<p>The 2011 frauds may not be recent, but their implications are profound. I direct you to a clear and concise explanation provided to journalist Constant Méheut:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tojournalists.com/open-letters/explanations-sent-to-constant-meheut-may-25-2022/">https://www.tojournalists.com/open-letters/explanations-sent-to-constant-meheut-may-25-2022/</a></p>
<p>Despite this, the general public remained unaware of being defrauded, illustrating the cunning nature of the deceit.</p>
<p>The European Parliament resolution, referenced in paragraph (482) of the report, underscores the severity of such malpractices, mandating that penalties should equate to or exceed the profits gleaned from these misleading acts.</p>
<p>For the 2011 frauds committed by McDonald’s France and their accomplices, the implications for McDonald’s legal and financial standing are profound, as detailed in this &ldquo;<em>assignation en justice</em>” (legal summons):</p>
<p><a href="https://archive20210730.cedricvillani.fr/docs/tgi/Signification-Assignation-BOULOGNE-BILLANCOURT-15-novembre-2016_Redacted%20small.pdf">https://archive20210730.cedricvillani.fr/docs/tgi/Signification-Assignation-BOULOGNE-BILLANCOURT-15-novembre-2016_Redacted%20small.pdf</a></p>
<p>It unequivocally demonstrates that should lawful proceedings prevail, the financial liabilities incurred would render McDonald’s France, and by extension, McDonald’s Corporation, insolvent.</p>
<p>The aftermath of the civil litigation is a testament to a deeply flawed process. Prior to its commencement, there were already a litany of instances involving the alteration, forging, falsification, and doctoring of public/legal/court/official documents—practices collectively referred to in French as “<em>faux écriture publique.</em>”</p>
<p>Despite being granted legal aid for the case, the lawyer assigned to me failed to take any action. My efforts to officially address this lack of effective legal assistance through the proper channels were met with silence; not a single response was provided by the French authorities.</p>
<p>Moreover, my interactions with the Advocate General, Jacques Cholet, took a disturbing turn when he resorted to issuing threats over the phone—a conversation that I have on record, which is admissible evidence in a court of law in France.</p>
<p>Consequently, I found myself compelled to take on significant financial burdens, accumulating substantial debt in order to retain the services of a private attorney and ensure the case was duly filed.</p>
<p>During the subsequent legal proceedings, I was unjustly denied the opportunity to formally respond to McDonald’s defense assertions, which I believe were not only fundamentally flawed but may have involved deceit on the part of McDonald’s and their legal representatives.</p>
<p>Moreover, I was deprived of the right to examine the evidence presented by their defense, including one piece of evidence I have reasonable grounds to suspect might include fabricated material. It is my fervent hope that with the forensic expertise of American authorities, the truth of this potentially fabricated piece of evidence will be brought to light.</p>
<p>The outcome of the case was a miscarriage of justice of the highest order. The verdict was handed down despite overwhelming evidence of McDonald’s widespread fraudulent practices.</p>
<p>Shockingly, the French judiciary falsely asserted that the adversarial process was upheld throughout the trial—a blatant lie that strikes at the very heart of judicial integrity.</p>
<p>Let me be unequivocally clear:</p>
<p><strong>IT IS AN OUTRAGEOUS FALSEHOOD AND A GRAVE INDICTMENT OF THE FRENCH JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO PERPETRATE SUCH A DECEPTION!</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, I was categorically denied the right to challenge McDonald’s defensive claims or even to inspect the evidence they submitted. This travesty of justice not only impugned my rights but also tarnished the principles of due process and fair trial that are foundational to any democratic legal system.</p>
<p>The proceedings degenerated into nothing short of a travesty, a mockery of justice. The judges, in a disconcerting dereliction of their duty, falsely professed adherence to adversarial principles. Such a proclamation was not merely erroneous—it was a deliberate misrepresentation, a subversion of the legal process that is both indefensible and reprehensible.</p>
<p>One might reasonably surmise that the prospect of media coverage from reputable outlets such as The New York Times on such a contentious matter would be slim, particularly in light of the ostensibly conclusive nature of the civil litigation&rsquo;s outcome. Yet, this presumption of conclusiveness is predicated on the assumption of a fair and impartial trial—an assumption grievously undermined by the sham nature of the proceedings. The trial, which I assert was fundamentally flawed, should not dissuade investigative journalism committed to uncovering the truth behind a veneer of judicial propriety.</p>
<p>Moreover, as I sought to exercise my right to appeal, I encountered yet another grave transgression: yet another &lsquo;<em>faux en écriture publique</em>&rsquo;—the illicit alteration or forgery of an official document—which effectively and unlawfully obstructed my path to appeal. This act of legal sabotage is not only reprehensible but also criminal, stripping away my fundamental legal recourse in seeking justice.</p>
<p><strong>I solemnly affirm, under penalty of perjury and with the gravest sincerity, that the account I have provided to you, Mr. Ambassador, represents the unvarnished truth of the matter.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Ambassador Lortholary, I implore you to uphold the highest standards of duty to our nation. Your decisive action in this matter is crucial for the integrity and economic safeguarding of France. I trust in your commitment to our country&rsquo;s values and the pursuit of justice in this pressing case.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Ambassador Lortholary, please don&rsquo;t betray your country.</strong></p>
<p>Your immediate action is critically needed. Again, I urge you to exercise the full scope of your authority to ensure that an exhaustive criminal investigation is immediately launched into the activities of McDonald’s Corporation and its affiliates. It is imperative for the integrity of our legal system that McDonald’s Corporation, along with any associated entities such as McDonald’s Europe, McDonald’s France, their franchisees, and all related executives and directors, be indicted for the crimes they&rsquo;ve engaged into, including but not limited to serious fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>Given the severity of the crimes and the evidence proving wrongdoing beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly concerning the manipulation of sweepstakes in 2016 and 2017, it is essential that all McDonald’s France employees, including the franchisees’ employees, who may have knowledge of or involvement in these activities be promptly interviewed by the appropriate law enforcement agencies, including the French National Police and the <em>Gendarmerie Nationale</em>. This is a crucial step toward ensuring that justice is served and that such crimes do not remain unaddressed.</p>
<p>I remain at your immediate disposal should you require any further clarification on this urgent matter.</p>
<p>With the highest regard and anticipation of your prompt action,</p>
<p>Vincent B. Le Corre</p>

        <span class="block pb-2">I am the key witness and whistleblower in the major criminal RICO case targeting McDonald’s Corporation and their accomplices for fraud, money laundering, and corruption of foreign officials and magistrates. Initially granted anonymity by the European Court of Human Rights (Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court), I made the decision in August 2023 to temporarily go public with my identity. This decision, driven by concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, was taken despite the potential risks, hoping it will be temporary only and that I can return to anonymity soon.</span>
