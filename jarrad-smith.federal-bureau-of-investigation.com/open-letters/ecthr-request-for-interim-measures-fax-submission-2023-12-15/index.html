  <p>This page is currently empty and might be updated later. I first need to redact some information from what was submitted to the Court since the Court‚Äôs records pertaining to this case, V.L.C. v. France (50552/22) have been sealed.</p>
<p id="paragraph_104">(104) A crucial element for future criminal investigations to determine is the potential connection between Judge Perrine Robert and the then Procureur G√©n√©ral of the Appeal Court, Marc Robert. If such a relationship exists, it would further implicate the Appeal Court in neglecting its duties, especially given their awareness of the lies perpetuated by the legal aid attorney assigned to my case. My speculation, based on limited evidence, is that Marc Robert might be related to Perrine Robert, potentially as her father-in-law. While this is speculative (I guess about 10% of chance) and based on scant information, it‚Äôs a lead that cannot be ignored given the dramatic nature of this case. Every potential coincidence and connection must be thoroughly examined to uncover the truth behind this egregious miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p id="paragraph_105">(105) In the aftermath of what can only be described as a judicial farce and sham trial, I was left disillusioned with the entire legal aid system, which I had already come to see as thoroughly ineffective. Despite this disillusionment, I applied for legal aid for the appeal process. Looking back, I now realize the importance of this step, as it further exposed the systemic issues within the judicial system. Predictably, my application for legal aid in the appeal was denied due to, yet again, another instance of the serious crime of ‚Äúfaux en √©criture publique‚Äù ‚Äì the deliberate falsification, doctoring, forging, and altering of an official court document. In this instance, a date within the judicial system was manipulated to falsely indicate that my application was filed too late, which was patently untrue, constituting another grave offense.</p>
<p id="paragraph_106">(106) While this pattern of serious crimes of ‚Äúfaux en √©criture publique‚Äù (the falsification/doctoring/forging/altering of court/legal/public/official documents/decisions) is not exclusive to my case against McDonald‚Äôs Corporation, it becomes particularly egregious in this context. The severity of McDonald‚Äôs alleged crimes ‚Äì including substantial frauds targeting a wide demographic, including children, and transnational money laundering with long-term detrimental economic impacts ‚Äì renders such ‚Äòerrors‚Äô absolutely indefensible. These are not mere oversights but a consistent pattern of serious crimes seemingly sanctioned, albeit unofficially, by the highest level of French officials and magistrates. This raises significant concerns about the ability of elected officials to govern justly and uphold the law. My rights, as protected under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are non-negotiable and must be upheld, irrespective of any political considerations or implications.</p>
<p id="paragraph_107">(107) When I received the decision in 2018, denying my legal aid for the appeal on the grounds of this serious crime of ‚Äúfaux en √©criture publique‚Äù (the falsification/doctoring/forging/altering of a court/legal/public/official document/decision) and coinciding with the European Court of Human Rights‚Äô rejection of the five cases I had submitted, I was plunged into deep despair. The ongoing psychological torment and the sense of injustice were overwhelming. The continued denial of justice, exacerbated by the apparent complicity of the judicial system in these malpractices, led me to the darkest depths of hopelessness.</p>
<p id="paragraph_108">(108) Between 2018 and early 2019, I tirelessly reached out to various high-ranking French officials and magistrates, including figures as prominent as President Macron, to shed light on the alarming instances of the serious crimes of ‚Äòfaux en √©criture publique‚Äô (the falsification/doctoring/forging/altering of court/legal/public/official documents/decisions) within the French judicial system. My communications were accompanied by indisputable evidence, such as mismatched dates on official documents, unequivocally demonstrating the manipulation and doctoring occurring at certain levels of the judiciary. The volume of examples I possess is substantial, but I will refrain from delving into each case due to the urgency of this current request.</p>
<p id="paragraph_109">(109) In the spring and summer of 2019, my focus turned to C√©dric Villani, a distinguished member of the French Parliament (Assembl√©e Nationale) and a Fields Medal laureate, an honor equivalent to the Nobel Prize in mathematics. Given the pervasive nature of ‚Äúfaux en √©criture publique‚Äù (the falsification/doctoring/forging/altering of court/legal/public/official documents/decisions) I had documented, I believed it was within his parliamentary responsibilities to oversee the government‚Äôs actions. I specifically highlighted one aspect of McDonald‚Äôs France‚Äôs alleged frauds from 2011: the evil mass-marketing scheme promising a 1 in 4 chance of instant wins. (Reminder: McDonald‚Äôs lied and defrauded tens of millions of consumers, the real probability of winning was in fact 1 in 8)</p>
<p id="paragraph_110">(110) August 2019: [SELF-CENSORED: In compliance with potential obligations under the [REDACTED] and other applicable legal frameworks, I am compelled to omit a pivotal detail that significantly pertains to this request for interim measures. This decision is made out of caution to avoid any unintentional violations of legal statutes, particularly those concerning [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].]</p>
<p id="paragraph_111">(111) Villani&rsquo;s office initially responded positively, expressing a willingness to assist. However, it became apparent that his attention was divided, as he was gearing up for his mayoral campaign in Paris. This political ambition seemingly overshadowed his obligations as a parliamentarian. In an effort to raise public awareness about the ongoing impunity with which McDonald&rsquo;s operated, I registered the domain names <a href="https://www.CedricVillani.com">CedricVillani.com</a> and <a href="https://www.CedricVillani.fr">CedricVillani.fr</a>, similar to my approach with other officials.</p>
<p id="paragraph_112">(112) The launch of the website (archived at <a href="https://archive20210730.cedricvillani.fr">https://archive20210730.cedricvillani.fr</a>) was met with serious threats from Villani‚Äôs Director of Communication, Philippe Mouricou. The pressure I faced from Mouricou was intense, with him even hinting at legal actions against me, despite my consistent clarification of the website‚Äôs unofficial status. This response only served to underscore the challenges I faced in my quest to bring these judicial malpractices to light.</p>
<p id="paragraph_113">(113) Philippe Mouricou‚Äôs accusation that I was employing tactics similar to McDonald‚Äôs, by allegedly pressuring C√©dric Villani, raised a significant concern for me. It hinted at the possibility that McDonald‚Äôs might have exerted influence over a French elected official. This suspicion gains further credence when considering the revelations in the book ‚ÄúI Sold My Soul to McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù (a very relevant and revealing book title in reference to the expression selling one‚Äôs soul to the devil) by Jean-Pierre Petit, former CEO of McDonald‚Äôs France. In this book, Petit boasts about McDonald‚Äôs influence over French politicians and their ability to silence the French Assembl√©e Nationale (the lower house of the bicameral French Parliament). Such admissions are alarming and suggest deep-seated corruption.</p>
<p id="paragraph_114">(114) Intriguingly, Petit‚Äôs book also seems to inadvertently admit violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), a point I&rsquo;ve elaborated on in my crime report to be submitted to the FBI.</p>
<p id="paragraph_115">(115) Following the threats from Villani‚Äôs director of communication and his erroneous invocation of the separation of powers as a justification for Villani‚Äôs inaction on these serious crimes, I reached out to the French anticorruption association Anticor. I inquired about the legal obligations of French elected officials to report crimes of which they are made aware. On September 27, 2019, Anticor‚Äôs response was clear and unequivocal: Yes, French elected officials do indeed have a legal duty to report such crimes. Additionally, Anticor voluntarily pointed out another pertinent law concerning
the failure to report serious crimes, which in itself constitutes a criminal offense. This likely refers to the ‚Äúfaux en √©criture publique‚Äù (the falsification/doctoring/forging/altering of court/legal/public/official documents/decisions) instances I had highlighted in my communications to French officials since 2018, many of which were CC‚Äôd to Anticor‚Äôs experts. Their responses and the evidence I presented likely led them to this conclusion, exposing the widespread and systematic nature of these document alterations.</p>
<p>(116) On September 27, 2019, I took the decisive step of forwarding Anticor&rsquo;s clarifying
response directly to Mr. C√©dric Villani, a member of the French Parliament, with the
following message which I translate directly into English:</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo the Attention of Mr. C√©dric Villani, Deputy of Essonne (5th constituency)</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Villani,</p>
<p>I have been subjected to repeated pressures and thinly veiled threats from your Director of Communication, Mr. Philippe Mouricou.</p>
<p>Following these incidents, I have decided to temporarily self-censor while drafting and submitting a request for interim measures to the European Court of Human Rights (Article 39 of the Court‚Äôs rules).</p>
<p>In one of our exchanges, Mr. Mouricou claimed ignorance regarding whether Article 40 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPP) applies to elected officials. I asked the question to Anticor. Their response is provided below.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Vincent Le Corre</p>
<p id="paragraph_116">[And I forwarded to Mr. Villani the email from the French anticorruption association
Anticor]‚Äù</p>
<p id="paragraph_117">(117) I also made Anticor‚Äôs response publicly available online.</p>
<p id="paragraph_118">(118) Interestingly, according to a Wall Street Journal article, the investigation into Steve Easterbrook, former CEO of McDonald‚Äôs Corporation, commenced approximately a week after I forwarded Anticor‚Äôs reply to Villani and published it online. This timing suggests a potential correlation between these events, underscoring the impact and reach of my efforts to bring these issues to light.</p>
<p id="paragraph_119">(119) Prior to these developments, I had publicly accused Steve Easterbrook, the then-CEO of McDonald‚Äôs Corporation, of being a white-collar criminal. I had repeatedly alerted McDonald‚Äôs executives to their ongoing criminal activities, but to no avail. The comprehensive crime report I am preparing to publish online substantiates these accusations with compelling evidence. I can provide the Court with an 81-page draft of this report for review.</p>
<p id="paragraph_174">(174) I remain uncertain about the true affiliation of the individual I met, whether he is connected to French [REDACTED] or if he was conveying a message on behalf of an embassy or consulate. Notably, he didn&rsquo;t just allude to the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) once, but twice. Upon reflection, I recall his first mention was less explicit than his subsequent reference. Intriguingly, during our initial interaction, he expressed a
personal hope that I would persist in my endeavors and not yield to any settlement offers.</p>
<p id="paragraph_175">(175) Moreover, this individual once remarked on aspects of my personal history in France, details I&rsquo;m certain I had never shared with him, especially those predating the year 2000. Such knowledge hints at a deeper awareness of my background, fueling my suspicion of his potential connections.</p>
<p id="paragraph_176">(176) As someone who values definitive proof, akin to a rigorous mathematical proof, I cannot conclusively assert whom this individual represents. However, the peculiarities of our interactions, coupled with later revelations that I am compelled to withhold due to compliance with the [REDACTED] and other relevant legal frameworks, suggest that what he told me was more than mere coincidence.</p>
<p id="paragraph_177">(177) The interactions with this individual, particularly the explicit nature of his communication during our second conversation, leave no room for doubt: his messages were not coincidental. He made it clear that the prospect of obtaining justice was directly tied to my willingness to sign a non-disclosure agreement. This is not a mere insinuation but an overt suggestion of conditional justice, contingent upon my agreement to remain silent. This proposition amounts to unmistakable blackmail, presenting a stark choice between silence and the pursuit of justice.</p>

        <span class="block pb-2">I am the key witness and whistleblower in the major criminal RICO case targeting McDonald‚Äôs Corporation and their accomplices for fraud, money laundering, and corruption of foreign officials and magistrates. Initially granted anonymity by the European Court of Human Rights (Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court), I made the decision in August 2023 to temporarily go public with my identity. This decision, driven by concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, was taken despite the potential risks, hoping it will be temporary only and that I can return to anonymity soon.</span>
