Through a binomial distribution approach, I demonstrate the vast disparity between the claimed and actual probabilities of winning, with real odds ranging from 1 in 1,000 to a staggering 1 in 10 billion.

This fraudulent misrepresentation of chances of winning as simple probability, when they are in fact outcomes of a complex binomial probability, underscores my appeal for witness protection in the face of such powerful entities operating akin to a crime syndicate.",

I argue that their statement of “1 chance out of 4” to win instantly must logically refer to each individual game stamp as an attempt, not a set of stamps. By leveraging the axiom of extension from set theory, I demonstrate that the differing number of game stamps offered with various menu options necessitates this interpretation of attempts. My email is a crucial clarification for the investigation, highlighting McDonald’s lack of transparency and the need for the FBI to recognize the underlying deceit in their criminal practices.",

I emphasize the critical difference between the number of instant-win elements and total sets, a distinction that dramatically affects the perceived odds of winning. My analysis reveals that the actual chance of securing a prize is closer to 1 in 8, not the widely marketed 1 in 4. This significant disparity points to a mass-marketing fraud campaign by a major corporation, one that even children are expected to navigate. I urge for this nuanced understanding of odds calculation to be recognized and corrected, highlighting the intricate fraudulence at play and the need for meticulous scrutiny.",

This distinction is vital in dissecting the fraudulent activities of McDonald’s in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I reference a flawed article by journalist Walter Hickey to illustrate common misconceptions, while also highlighting the accurate definition of probability as given by David Morin from Harvard University. My expectation is that FBI and Justice Department agents not only grasp the fundamental concept of probability, but also recognize the impact of the number of trials in a Binomial distribution on the outcome.

I express urgency for the FBI and the Justice Department to grasp the nuanced distinction between an element and a set, a foundational concept that underpins the sophisticated mechanics of the crimes in question.

  </a>
  
    In one of my analysis, I uncover the truth behind McDonald’s “1 in 4” odds in their Monopoly sweepstakes. Through a binomial distribution approach, I demonstrate the vast disparity between the claimed and actual probabilities of winning, with real odds ranging from 1 in 1,000 to a staggering 1 in 10 billion. This investigation highlights a systematic pattern of mass-marketing fraud within McDonald’s promotions. I call for immediate action from the U.S. Department of Justice to address these criminal practices that significantly skew market competition and defraud consumers worldwide.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Clarifying Probabilities to the FBI: Simple Probability vs. Binomial Distribution Probability</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my correspondence with the FBI, I elucidate the critical distinctions between simple probability and binomial distribution probability, highlighting the substantial implications these differences have in the context of this mass-marketing fraud case affecting many countries around the world. I argue that without explicit clarification, consumers, including minors, were inevitably defrauded by the criminal practices of the corporate predator that McDonald’s Corporation is. This fraudulent misrepresentation of chances of winning as simple probability, when they are in fact outcomes of a complex binomial probability, underscores my appeal for witness protection in the face of such powerful entities operating akin to a crime syndicate.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my communication with Mr. Rogalski from the FBI, I suggest a focus on money laundering as an entry point into the McDonald’s investigation, acknowledging the complexity of probabilities involved in the case. I share my ongoing research efforts and draw parallels between McDonald’s alleged activities and those of known fraudster Lance Armstrong, to illustrate the potential scale of deceit. My plea for transparency and information—specifically regarding the lead agent, case number, and FBI Victim Specialist—is a clear call for updates and support as I navigate through the intertwining legal and financial ramifications that this case presents.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my correspondence with Mr. Rogalski at the FBI, I underscore the importance of understanding McDonald’s fraudulent probability claims in France during 2011. I argue that their statement of “1 chance out of 4” to win instantly must logically refer to each individual game stamp as an attempt, not a set of stamps. By leveraging the axiom of extension from set theory, I demonstrate that the differing number of game stamps offered with various menu options necessitates this interpretation of attempts. My email is a crucial clarification for the investigation, highlighting McDonald’s lack of transparency and the need for the FBI to recognize the underlying deceit in their criminal practices.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my communication with the FBI, I dissect a Business Insider article to clarify the misconceptions surrounding McDonald’s Monopoly promotion probabilities. I emphasize the critical difference between the number of instant-win elements and total sets, a distinction that dramatically affects the perceived odds of winning. My analysis reveals that the actual chance of securing a prize is closer to 1 in 8, not the widely marketed 1 in 4. This significant disparity points to a mass-marketing fraud campaign by a major corporation, one that even children are expected to navigate. I urge for this nuanced understanding of odds calculation to be recognized and corrected, highlighting the intricate fraudulence at play and the need for meticulous scrutiny.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Clarifying Probability Concepts for the FBI Investigation : the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my recent email to the FBI, I stress the importance of understanding key probability concepts—specifically, the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions. This distinction is vital in dissecting the fraudulent activities of McDonald’s in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I reference a flawed article by journalist Walter Hickey to illustrate common misconceptions, while also highlighting the accurate definition of probability as given by David Morin from Harvard University. My expectation is that FBI and Justice Department agents not only grasp the fundamental concept of probability, but also recognize the impact of the number of trials in a Binomial distribution on the outcome. This understanding is crucial for unraveling the complexities of the case at hand.<br>

    In my email to the FBI, I aim to shed light on the set theory and its pertinence to the FBI’s investigation of McDonald’s Corporation’s criminal activities. I express urgency for the FBI and the Justice Department to grasp the nuanced distinction between an element and a set, a foundational concept that underpins the sophisticated mechanics of the crimes in question. Amidst my call for clarity and action, I also convey my anticipation for a response regarding the lead investigator of the racketeering case, hinting at the necessity to involve oversight agencies should the silence persist. My message underscores the critical need for understanding mathematical principles in unraveling the intricacies of the serious crimes committed by the transnational crimal entity McDonald’s Corporation.<br>

This page reveals my insights on how small, criminally obtained advantages, when systematically exploited, can lead to substantial and unfair dominance in the business world.

  </a>
  
    I give to the F.B.I. 3 concrete examples of serious frauds McDonald’s Corporation and/or its affiliated companies committed. This should have been enough for the F.B.I. to initiate a criminal investigation targeting McDonald’s Corporation and/or its subsidiary companies for fraud and money laundering.<br>
