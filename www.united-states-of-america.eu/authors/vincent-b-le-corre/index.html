On February 16, 2023, I received formal notification from the European Court of Human Rights that my request for anonymity (under Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court) was accepted. However, in August 2023, due to concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, I made the difficult decision to temporarily go public with my identity.
My efforts to alert the FBI about the activities of McDonald’s Corporation began in earnest in 2015 and intensified from September 2021, with a significant increase in these efforts starting in September 2022.">

I emphasize the urgency due to the looming statute of limitations for serious frauds committed in 2011 and 2017. Detailing the extensive documentation submitted to the FBI, I highlight the involvement of McDonald’s France in fraudulent activities and the tacit approval from higher-ups in the corporation. The testimony of a McDonald’s France employee provides damning evidence, raising questions about the company’s internal compliance with legal standards. With mathematical analysis backing my claims of rigged sweepstakes, I assert the need for a thorough investigation. My correspondence also touches on the troubling experiences I’ve had with the French legal system, including threats and a miscarriage of justice in my case against McDonald’s. I implore the Ambassador to take immediate action, underscoring the importance of this issue for the economic and legal integrity of France. This letter is a heartfelt appeal for justice and a call for transparency, urging a comprehensive criminal investigation into McDonald’s and its affiliates for their involvement in serious fraud and money laundering.",

I question why McDonald’s chose not to state a straightforward “1 chance out of 8.” I emphasize the importance of upholding the law consistently, especially when it comes to large corporations, and express my concerns about the broader implications of such fraudulent practices on the integrity of financial systems. My correspondence serves as a call to action for the FBI to investigate these practices, which I believe are part of a larger pattern of criminal activity by McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices.",

I reference the explanation I provided to New York Times journalist Constant Méheut about the instant-win fraud in France for 2011, asserting its relevance to the U.S. operations of McDonald’s in 2013. I emphasize the significance of McDonald’s fraudulent claim of “one-in-four odds of winning” for their 2013 U.S. promotion, critically analyzing the calculation basis they provided and highlighting the deviation from their stated odds. This correspondence serves as a stark reminder of the serious implications of these allegations, particularly when they involve targeting children, and questions the integrity of McDonald’s practices. I express concern over the security of my personal information and communications, seeking the FBI’s attention and action in a case that I argue has deep legal and ethical ramifications.",

<p>On February 16, 2023, I received formal notification from the European Court of Human Rights that my request for anonymity (under Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court) was accepted. However, in August 2023, due to concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, I made the difficult decision to temporarily go public with my identity.</p>
<p>My efforts to alert the FBI about the activities of McDonald’s Corporation began in earnest in 2015 and intensified from September 2021, with a significant increase in these efforts starting in September 2022. I am actively communicating with American authorities, and some of these communications addressed to the FBI are publicly available on <a href="https://www.federal-bureau-of-investigation.com/open-letters/">Federal-Bureau-of-Investigation.com/open-letters/</a>, a <em>non-official</em> website on the FBI that I created for transparency in this significant crime case.</p>
<p>McDonald’s Corporation has perpetrated one of the largest frauds in history, involving multiple instances of mass-marketing fraud across various nations. This has given McDonald&rsquo;s and its accomplices an unfair financial advantage over competitors, enabling them to reach their current colossal size. A concise timeline of these events is available at <a href="https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/mcdonalds/">https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/mcdonalds/</a>.</p>
<p>The absence of a judicial response from the French authorities raises serious concerns. It suggests either a dangerous level of incompetence or potential corruption within their ranks. In his book &ldquo;I Sold My Soul to McDonald&rsquo;s,&rdquo; former McDonald&rsquo;s France CEO Jean-Pierre Petit seemingly boasts about the company&rsquo;s influence over politicians, highlighting the gravity of the situation.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-0">A French Foreign Ministry Official Reads a Sensitive Email Not Initially Addressed to Him</h3>
  </a>
  
    An official email reporting a serious threat was sent on April 19, 2025, to several high-ranking French and Chinese authorities, including senators, diplomats, intelligence services, and journalists. Although Samuel Belbachir, an official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was neither a direct recipient nor copied on the message, a read receipt confirms he accessed the message on April 21 at 10:30 a.m. It is possible that the email was internally forwarded to him as part of the administrative or diplomatic handling of the case.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Ambassador Lortholary, Please Don’t Betray Your Country: Plea for Justice and Intervention to French Ambassador</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my letter to His Excellency Bertrand Lortholary, the Ambassador of France to China, I articulate the critical nature of ongoing legal issues involving McDonald’s Corporation. I emphasize the urgency due to the looming statute of limitations for serious frauds committed in 2011 and 2017. Detailing the extensive documentation submitted to the FBI, I highlight the involvement of McDonald’s France in fraudulent activities and the tacit approval from higher-ups in the corporation. The testimony of a McDonald’s France employee provides damning evidence, raising questions about the company’s internal compliance with legal standards. With mathematical analysis backing my claims of rigged sweepstakes, I assert the need for a thorough investigation. My correspondence also touches on the troubling experiences I’ve had with the French legal system, including threats and a miscarriage of justice in my case against McDonald’s. I implore the Ambassador to take immediate action, underscoring the importance of this issue for the economic and legal integrity of France. This letter is a heartfelt appeal for justice and a call for transparency, urging a comprehensive criminal investigation into McDonald’s and its affiliates for their involvement in serious fraud and money laundering.<br>

  </a>
  
    In one of my analysis, I uncover the truth behind McDonald’s “1 in 4” odds in their Monopoly sweepstakes. Through a binomial distribution approach, I demonstrate the vast disparity between the claimed and actual probabilities of winning, with real odds ranging from 1 in 1,000 to a staggering 1 in 10 billion. This investigation highlights a systematic pattern of mass-marketing fraud within McDonald’s promotions. I call for immediate action from the U.S. Department of Justice to address these criminal practices that significantly skew market competition and defraud consumers worldwide.<br>

    In my correspondence with the FBI, I elucidate the critical distinctions between simple probability and binomial distribution probability, highlighting the substantial implications these differences have in the context of this mass-marketing fraud case affecting many countries around the world. I argue that without explicit clarification, consumers, including minors, were inevitably defrauded by the criminal practices of the corporate predator that McDonald’s Corporation is. This fraudulent misrepresentation of chances of winning as simple probability, when they are in fact outcomes of a complex binomial probability, underscores my appeal for witness protection in the face of such powerful entities operating akin to a crime syndicate.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my email to the FBI, I convey my frustrations over the bureaucratic process I’ve encountered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). I discuss how my Freedom of Information Act request was altered into a Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act request, creating a perplexing situation regarding access to my own report submitted in 2015<br>

  </a>
  
    In my email to Messrs. Manjarrez and Rogalski, I express my challenges in submitting a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI due to citizenship verification issues. I question the apparent barriers faced by foreigners in accessing information under the Privacy Act of 1974. This frustration is compounded by my concern over the lack of response from the SEC since November 2022. I emphasize the importance of transparency in my case, which involves allegations against McDonald’s Corporation and a criminal complaint filed by the former French Minister of Justice. I highlight my previous attempts to alert the FBI in 2015 and my recent efforts to reach out again after learning of the complaint against me. My request seeks all information the FBI may have about me and my case. This email underscores my persistent pursuit of clarity and my rights as a victim in an international legal context.<br>

    In my email to Mr. Adam Rogalski at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, I stress the importance of notifying the Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit about McDonald’s Corporation’s misconduct. I reference the unit’s collaboration with regulatory partners like the SEC, emphasizing a similar approach I suggested to the FBI in 2015. My correspondence includes links to a transcript and a YouTube video of a previous call with the FBI, where I discussed the potential for joint investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. I argue for a coordinated effort between the SEC and FBI to investigate McDonald’s, underscoring the gravity of the situation. This email reflects my persistent efforts to seek justice and accountability in a case with significant legal and economic implications.<br>

I share my ongoing research efforts and draw parallels between McDonald’s alleged activities and those of known fraudster Lance Armstrong, to illustrate the potential scale of deceit. My plea for transparency and information—specifically regarding the lead agent, case number, and FBI Victim Specialist—is a clear call for updates and support as I navigate through the intertwining legal and financial ramifications that this case presents.<br>

    In my correspondence with Mr. Rogalski at the FBI, I underscore the importance of understanding McDonald’s fraudulent probability claims in France during 2011. I argue that their statement of “1 chance out of 4” to win instantly must logically refer to each individual game stamp as an attempt, not a set of stamps. By leveraging the axiom of extension from set theory, I demonstrate that the differing number of game stamps offered with various menu options necessitates this interpretation of attempts. My email is a crucial clarification for the investigation, highlighting McDonald’s lack of transparency and the need for the FBI to recognize the underlying deceit in their criminal practices.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">60 Million Consumers: Addressing the Scale of McDonald’s Frauds</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my communication with the FBI, I discuss the immense scale of McDonald’s global consumer base, highlighting the potential for significant financial impact from even minor price manipulations. I contemplate the temptation for McDonald’s to cross legal boundaries for profit, especially given their daily interaction with 60 million consumers worldwide. The prospect of gaining just an additional quarter per customer translates to substantial annual revenue, underscoring the possible motivations behind their fraudulent activities, including the McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes. I hint at ongoing serious infractions by McDonald’s France that could greatly influence the market and competition. My focus remains on the Monopoly sweepstakes frauds, with an urgent call to consider a RICO indictment against McDonald’s. This email aims to shed light on the magnitude of potential corporate wrongdoing and the need for decisive legal action.<br>

  </a>
  
    In part 3, I share an analogy to illustrate the mass-marketing fraud McDonald’s committed in China, hoping it clarifies the situation’s obviousness. Given that China ratified the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC, also known as the Palermo Convention) on September 23, 2003, I believe the country should be part of the international effort to take down the transnational criminal enterprise orchestrated by McDonald’s Corporation.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my communication with the FBI, I dissect a Business Insider article to clarify the misconceptions surrounding McDonald’s Monopoly promotion probabilities. I emphasize the critical difference between the number of instant-win elements and total sets, a distinction that dramatically affects the perceived odds of winning. My analysis reveals that the actual chance of securing a prize is closer to 1 in 8, not the widely marketed 1 in 4. This significant disparity points to a mass-marketing fraud campaign by a major corporation, one that even children are expected to navigate. I urge for this nuanced understanding of odds calculation to be recognized and corrected, highlighting the intricate fraudulence at play and the need for meticulous scrutiny.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Clarifying Probability Concepts for the FBI Investigation : the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my recent email to the FBI, I stress the importance of understanding key probability concepts—specifically, the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions. This distinction is vital in dissecting the fraudulent activities of McDonald’s in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I reference a flawed article by journalist Walter Hickey to illustrate common misconceptions, while also highlighting the accurate definition of probability as given by David Morin from Harvard University. My expectation is that FBI and Justice Department agents not only grasp the fundamental concept of probability, but also recognize the impact of the number of trials in a Binomial distribution on the outcome. This understanding is crucial for unraveling the complexities of the case at hand.<br>

    In my email to the FBI, I aim to shed light on the set theory and its pertinence to the FBI’s investigation of McDonald’s Corporation’s criminal activities. I express urgency for the FBI and the Justice Department to grasp the nuanced distinction between an element and a set, a foundational concept that underpins the sophisticated mechanics of the crimes in question. Amidst my call for clarity and action, I also convey my anticipation for a response regarding the lead investigator of the racketeering case, hinting at the necessity to involve oversight agencies should the silence persist.

My email seeks to understand the progress of the investigation and Mr. Rogalski’s involvement. I offer to clarify any complexities he might face and urge for a response.

This message to the FBI calls for an urgent and thorough investigation into these serious allegations, underscoring the necessity of immediate action and accountability for what I describe as clear instances of organized crime within a major RICO framework.

I argue that, in reality, the odds were closer to “1 chance out of 8,” a figure never stated by the corporation. My goal is to demonstrate the fraud in their probability claims and to clarify the real chances of winning based on a single game stamp. I urge Mr. Rogalski (State Department/FBI) to ensure the FBI is aware of these issues, as they have ramifications in numerous countries. I urge the FBI to alert INTERPOL. This email is an attempt to unravel the complexities of the situation, seeking clarity and accountability in one of the largest fraud cases in history.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my correspondence with Mr. Adam Rogalski, Assistant Legal Attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, I delve into my longstanding belief that the U.S. version of the McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes constitutes an illegal lottery. Citing a detailed explanation on a website, I argue that the promotion’s claim of “NO PURCHASE NECESSARY” is misleading, as statistical analysis suggests that participating without a purchase might be more costly than the prizes offered. Additionally, I challenge the assertion that “PURCHASE WILL NOT IMPROVE CHANCES OF WINNING.” I propose that, theoretically, a wealthy enough individual could secure all prizes by purchasing all game stamps, thereby guaranteeing victory, which contradicts McDonald’s claim. These inconsistencies, I believe, point towards fraudulent practices. I also suggest the FBI question former McDonald’s executive Gloria Santona, as her departure timing might be significant. My aim is to highlight the potential deception in this widely known sweepstakes and the need for thorough investigation.<br>

This, I argue, is a clear case of mass marketing fraud driven by greed, designed to artificially boost sales. I question why McDonald’s chose not to state a straightforward “1 chance out of 8.” I emphasize the importance of upholding the law consistently, especially when it comes to large corporations, and express my concerns about the broader implications of such fraudulent practices on the integrity of financial systems. My correspondence serves as a call to action for the FBI to investigate these practices, which I believe are part of a larger pattern of criminal activity by McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Exposing RICO Violations by McDonald’s to the FBI</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my email to the FBI, I detail the racketeering activity within McDonald’s Corporation, specifically in the context of the United States. I reference the explanation I provided to New York Times journalist Constant Méheut about the instant-win fraud in France for 2011, asserting its relevance to the U.S. operations of McDonald’s in 2013. I emphasize the significance of McDonald’s fraudulent claim of “one-in-four odds of winning” for their 2013 U.S. promotion, critically analyzing the calculation basis they provided and highlighting the deviation from their stated odds. This correspondence serves as a stark reminder of the serious implications of these allegations, particularly when they involve targeting children, and questions the integrity of McDonald’s practices. I express concern over the security of my personal information and communications, seeking the FBI’s attention and action in a case that I argue has deep legal and ethical ramifications.<br>

  </a>
  
    I reach out with a personal appeal to the FBI and State Department, requesting clear communication and support in a complex fraud case. Amid the turmoil of being a key witness against a formidable corporate adversary, I convey my struggle for peace and the heavy toll of ongoing stress. I emphasize my need for confidentiality in certain discussions, along with psychological support, underscoring the gravity of the situation and my earnest quest for assistance and understanding from law enforcement.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Answer from French anticorruption association Anticor related to the McDonald’s case.</h3>
  </a>
  
    Answer from French anticorruption association Anticor. I would forward their reply to Cédric Villani, a member of the French Parliament. The internal investigation targeting Steve Easterbrook would start about 1 week after this email I received from Anticor. Coincidence? Maybe. But it’s a fact that there is parallel truth which was happening at the same time. I personally don’t think it’s a coincidence.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Witness Tampering: Threats Received from French Elected Official Cédric Villani</h3>
  </a>
  
    On September 25, 2019, Philippe Mouricou, the director of communication of French elected official Cédric Villani contacted me and he would quickly start issuing threats against me thus committing the crime of witness tampering. He accused at some point of using the same methods as McDonald’s which seem to imply that McDonald’s might have pressured a French elected official. If McDonald’s pressured a French elected official, it might fall under the FCPA.<br>

The correspondence sent by his team, underscores Villani’s sensitivity and commitment to addressing these serious allegations. Despite his heavy professional commitments, the response reassures me that Cédric Villani’s office has given full attention to the issue and is prepared to take action if possible.<br>

  </a>
  
    My heartfelt plea to Cédric Villani, a Member of the French Parliament, seeking his assistance in exposing one of the largest frauds in history involving McDonald’s Corporation. In my letter, I describe myself as both a victim and a whistleblower, passionately arguing against McDonald’s criminal practices in their Monopoly sweepstakes, where the company falsely claimed a “1 in 4 chance of winning instantly”—a deceptive assertion, as the actual odds were 1 in 8. I urgently request Villani’s mathematical expertise to affirm the rigged probabilities and urge immediate action to compel McDonald’s to compensate millions of consumers defrauded by their games, highlighting the necessity of upholding the rule of law against such corporate deceit.<br>

In this email, I alerted them to the serious dysfunctions of the French judicial system. I also provided 7 concrete examples of the serious crime of falsification/doctoring/altering/forging of a court/public/official/legal document/decision, under articles 441-1 and 441-4 of the French criminal code. I alerted them that there are at least several billion euros in fines to be imposed on the McDonald&#39;s group.<br>

  </a>
  
    Email from Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, confirming to me that procedural contracts are invented by the bar associations, the jurisdictions, and the legal aid offices, and that this is something truly preposterous! That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it. In essence, this situation amounts to the judicial branch circumventing the legislative branch to create its own laws, a practice that is profoundly dangerous. It undermines the principle of the separation of powers, a cornerstone of democratic governance.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Third Formal Notice Sent to McDonald’s France and French Ministerial Office Regarding Fraudulent Practices</h3>
  </a>
  
    In a formal notice dated May 30, 2013, addressed to McDonald’s France and a French Ministerial Office (huissier de justice), allegations of fraudulent marketing practices are detailed with a potential invocation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The notice accuses McDonald’s of deceiving consumers through disproportionate distribution of promotional game stamps and asserts potential government collusion. It emphasizes the legal implications, including potential civil and criminal charges, and demands McDonald’s address the issues or face widespread legal action across France. The document serves as a prelude to formal legal proceedings, stressing the need for transparency and accountability from the multinational corporation.<br>
