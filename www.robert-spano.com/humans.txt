Hello. I am the key witness, and in a way also a whistleblower also, in the major RICO case targeting McDonaldâ€™s Corporation for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity (RICO). I prefer to remain anonymous to avoid being pressured/harassed/blackmailed/threatened. I was notified on February 16, 2023, that the European Court of Human Rights accepted my request for anonymity. You can visit the following websites for more details: X-v-France.com, ECtHRwatch.org, Federal-Bureau-of-Investigation.com (NON-OFFICIAL website on the FBI created for the purpose of transparency). There are many more websites. On ECtHRwatch.org/other-websites/ you can find more websites to explore.
