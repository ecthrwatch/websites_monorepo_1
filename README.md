# websites_monorepo_1
Single repository that stores most of the websites, if not all of them, that I've created to publicly denounce the aggravated frauds committed by the transnational criminal enterprise McDonald's Corporation.

The purpose of this monorepo is for you to easily backup what I explain regarding the aggravated frauds committed by McDonald's Corporation in the event I would get arrested.
