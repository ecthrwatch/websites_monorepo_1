      <description>Who am I? On February 16, 2023, I was formally notified that the European Court of Human Rights agreed to accept my request for anonymity. Therefore, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about me. I want to talk about the crimes McDonald’s Corporation and their accomplices have committed over the years. I want to talk about what the judicial authorities are doing to bring McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices to justice.
I am currently actively notifying the American authorities.</description>
