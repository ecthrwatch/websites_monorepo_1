# Other websites related to the McDonald's frauds cases

[ECtHRwatch - Official website](https://www.ECtHRwatch.org) : I will list all the cases I file with the European Court of Human Rights.

[Robert Spano (Robert-Spano.com)](https://www.Robert-Spano.com) : Róbert Ragnar Spanó, President of the European Court of Human Rights. Non-official website.

[X. in X. v France (X-v-France.com)](https://www.x-v-france.com) : I intend to ask to the President of the European Court of Human Rights the right to remain anonymous. The case involving McDonald's Corporation could end up getting a great deal of media attention. I intend to remain anonymous.

[Federal-Bureau-of-Investigation.com (NON-OFFICIAL)](https://www.Federal-Bureau-of-Investigation.com) : This is a non-official website about the F.B.I. on which I intend to openly publish my communications to them. McDonald's France has committed multiple counts of aggravated fraud. In 2015, I formally warned the U.S. executives working for McDonald's Corporation. They acknowledged taking the inquiry seriously but nevertheless failed to put an end to an ongoing aggravated fraud which was then taking place in Europe. I believe RICO charged could be brought against them.
