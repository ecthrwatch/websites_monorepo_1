# About Europe-v-McDonalds.org

I am accusing the fast-food chain McDonald's Corporation of having committed aggravated fraud in Europe, in France in particular. It is one of the biggest fraud in history.

I intend to ask for witness/whistleblower protection.

Tens of millions of consumers have been defrauded over the years. In addition to the aggravated frauds McDonald's knowingly and repeatedly committed in France, I believe additional violations of the law occured in other countries of the European Union.

By repeatedly committing aggravated fraud over the years, McDonald's has greatly undermined competition.

I intend to ask various officials and institutions of the European Union to launch a criminal investigation into this matter.
