THIS EMAIL CONTAINS WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE VERY IMPORTANT LEGAL INFORMATION. DON’T DISREGARD IT!

Dear Mr. Easterbrook, dear Ms. Santona, and dear Mr. Hicks,
I repeat again. Please stop the fraud. You must make it stop!
I know you know this “game” is a fraud under European laws. You can not possibly be so stupid not to understand except if you don’t understand on purpose so that you can later claim plausible deniability.</description>

Ms Santona,
Thank you for answering me. Could you please make sure the French team communicate with me by email? Normal mail takes forever for me to receive now that I live in China and I am not going to wait one month to act if there is an ongoing fraud.</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

Ms. Santona,
First of all, I want to thank you for having taken my phone call today without hanging up on me right away. Your counter-part in France, Mme de Borda, always refused to communicate with me through phone. Therefore, I greatly appreciate the fact you’ve listened to what I had to say, really.</description>
