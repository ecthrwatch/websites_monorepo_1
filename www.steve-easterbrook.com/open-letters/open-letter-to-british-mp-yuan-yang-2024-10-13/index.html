<p><strong>NB:</strong> This document is being published for the first time on April 27, 2025. I initially sent the original, unredacted version to British Member of Parliament Yuan Yang on October 13, 2024. At that time, I refrained from publicly disclosing certain sensitive information out of concern that doing so might constitute a violation of the U.S. Espionage Act. However, I note that by forwarding the unredacted material to a non-American citizen, I may already have violated the Act.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> In this public version, certain sensitive information — including specific names and references to individuals — has been replaced with [REDACTED] to protect personal safety and privacy. The original letter sent to Ms. Yuan Yang included the full, unredacted information.</p>
<p>Ms. Yuan YANG, Member of the Parliament<br>
Parliamentary Office<br>
House of Commons<br>
London<br>
SW1A 0AA<br>
United Kingdom<br>
Email: <a href="mailto:yuan.yang.mp@parliament.uk">yuan.yang.mp@parliament.uk</a></p>
<p>Dear Ms. Yang,</p>
<p>Please note that this is an open letter, made publicly available due to the gravity of the matter and the lack of response from relevant authorities.</p>
<p>I am writing to seek your urgent assistance regarding a situation that endangers the lives of my loved ones in China and myself. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Due to the confirmed involvement of foreign espionage connected to this case, we could potentially face severe consequences, including the death penalty.</span> <strong>Your support is crucial in navigating this perilous situation.</strong></p>
<p>We were previously in contact during your tenure at <em>The Financial Times</em> in Beijing, where you kindly agreed to meet with me. Unfortunately, circumstances prevented me from traveling to Beijing to share my story in person. I have attached a copy of your reply dated February 25, 2020, which includes my initial email expressing fears of arrest at that time.</p>
<p>Since then, the situation has escalated significantly. I am now subject to what can only be described as an unofficial gag order. For a partial account, please refer to the attached documents: <strong>&ldquo;2023-12-13-DOD-IG-HOTLINE.pdf&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;WebForm2.pdf&rdquo;</strong>. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">These documents are part of the complaint I filed with the United States Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General (DoD OIG).</span></p>
<p>As a French citizen and permanent resident in China, I recognize that I am not within your constituency. However, the international dimensions of this case—particularly involving money laundering and potential national security threats linked to British companies—transcend national borders and involve multiple nations across Europe and around the world. The involvement of the American intelligence community adds significant urgency, impacting not only foreign economies but also the rule of law and the UK&rsquo;s economic and national security.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-crimes">Overview of the Crimes</h2>
<h3 id="mass-marketing-fraud-and-money-laundering">Mass-Marketing Fraud and Money Laundering</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, <strong>McDonald’s Corporation</strong> and its accomplices have engaged in recurring criminal activities through mass-marketing frauds, followed by money laundering. While it may seem improbable that a publicly listed corporation would participate in organized crime, evidence proves that McDonald’s Corporation did exactly that.</p>
<p>Upon alerting them, they had the opportunity to halt these ongoing frauds but chose not to. Their decision to condone these criminal activities, following my alert to their headquarters in Chicago, has serious implications. These actions are tied, I believe, to the 2019 firing of British CEO <strong>Steve Easterbrook</strong>. Such fraudulent schemes, especially when they cross international borders, fall under the <strong>United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Convention)</strong>, underscoring the severity of their misconduct.</p>
<h2 id="the-united-kingdoms-involvement">The United Kingdom&rsquo;s Involvement</h2>
<h3 id="failure-to-act-and-complicity">Failure to Act and Complicity</h3>
<p>For years, <strong>McDonald’s France</strong> ignored my warnings, prompting me to escalate the matter to their headquarters in Chicago in 2015. Then-General Counsel <strong>Gloria Santona</strong> acknowledged that they were taking the issue seriously, yet they ultimately failed to stop the ongoing frauds. By allowing this to continue, McDonald’s Corporation entered a dangerous downward spiral.</p>
<p>It appears that the U.S. headquarters directed its subsidiary, <strong>McDonald’s Europe</strong>, based in London, to handle the matter—likely an attempt to distance themselves from stringent U.S. laws on fraud and money laundering. However, McDonald’s Europe which is based in London, along with one of its senior executives, <strong>Malcolm Hicks</strong>, who I believe holds dual American and British citizenship, actively participated in this criminal enterprise. By refusing to stop the ongoing fraud, both the company and the executive became directly complicit.</p>
<p>Despite this, I continued to alert McDonald’s Corporation in the U.S., as they remain at the apex of this global network, orchestrating and directing the actions of their subsidiaries. I believe the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> must indict them. Their repeated failure to act indicates willful misconduct, further corroborated by damning testimony in the memoirs of former McDonald’s France CEO <strong>Jean-Pierre Petit</strong>, who provides crucial insights into the company&rsquo;s operations.</p>
<h2 id="implication-of-us-intelligence">Implication of U.S. Intelligence</h2>
<h3 id="espionage-activities">Espionage Activities</h3>
<p>While living in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, we encountered American Christian missionaries who, as I later understood, were working for U.S. intelligence—at least some of them. [REDACTED], from [REDACTED] (mentioned in my DoD OIG complaint), made this clear in July 2023. While a public official confirmation is unlikely, I firmly believe, beyond a reasonable doubt and based on numerous events, that this is true. The attached DoD OIG complaint provides more details, although it is a summary composed under pressure and omits many additional details I could provide.</p>
<p>It was only about a week ago that I realized the use of clergy by the CIA has been public knowledge since the <strong>Church Committee</strong> hearings in the U.S. Senate in the mid-1970s. This revelation significantly influenced my decision to grant access to my DoD OIG complaint to selected non-American citizens whom I trust to handle the information responsibly and not release it publicly. Just yesterday, I was reading the <strong>“Hearing Before the Select Committee on Intelligence of the United States Senate, One Hundred Fourth Congress, Second Session, on the CIA&rsquo;s Use of Journalists and Clergy in Intelligence Operations,”</strong> dated July 17, 1996. <span style="color:red">This document confirms the CIA&rsquo;s use of clergy in intelligence operations, aligning with my experiences.</span></p>
<p>It was only a couple of months ago that I realized this method of operation wasn’t isolated to Taiyuan but appeared to be widespread across China, as I’ve witnessed similarly troubling events here in Beijing.</p>
<p>The 1996 Senate hearing seems to be the last public inquiry into the CIA’s use of journalists and clergy in intelligence operations. However, I can personally attest, based on my own experience, that contrary to former CIA Director <strong>John Deutch</strong>’s statement that such practices would occur under “extremely rare, indeed highly improbable circumstances,” I have witnessed their extensive use from 2019 up until now in 2024.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s because I live in China, but I’ve observed disturbing practices, such as individuals posing as Christian missionaries using electronic surveillance to spy on locals and even citizens from allied countries like France (as I myself experienced). One even fraudulently claimed to have received spiritual gifts from the Holy Spirit to explain how he knew personal information that wasn’t publicly available. These individuals are master manipulators, and it’s deeply ironic that one of the unofficial mottos of the CIA is, <strong>“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32)</strong>. Sadly, it seems that some members of the American intelligence community have become slaves to sin.</p>
<h2 id="concerns-about-us-practices">Concerns About U.S. Practices</h2>
<h3 id="erosion-of-democratic-principles">Erosion of Democratic Principles</h3>
<p>It is disheartening to witness a nation like the United States resort to unethical practices, <em>seemingly</em> protecting criminal enterprises like McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices, who have been operating in this manner for over a decade. What has happened to America?</p>
<p>As a Christian, I find these methods not only questionable but also illegal and immoral. This must stop. But the pressing question remains: <strong>how do we stop it?</strong></p>
<p>As then-Senator <strong>John Kerry</strong> remarked during the 1996 hearing on the CIA’s use of journalists and clergy, <strong>“I am very uncomfortable with the public discussions, and that&rsquo;s all that I would say at this point.”</strong> I feel much the same way. I’m uncomfortable even discussing this privately, knowing that my loved ones and I, being in China, could theoretically face the death penalty for espionage-related accusations.</p>
<p>However, it’s ironic that the CIA’s use of journalists and clergy seems to have bipartisan approval from both Democrats and Republicans. I was personally spied upon during President <strong>Donald Trump&rsquo;s</strong> presidency, and I recently came across a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article titled <strong>“The Evangelicals Calling for &lsquo;Spiritual Warfare&rsquo; to Elect Trump.”</strong> This makes me question what significant changes have taken place since the 1996 hearing, which included the following statement:</p>
<p><strong>“We request the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government and the Select Committees on Intelligence of the Congress to cooperate in continuing to prohibit such inappropriate collaboration. We request that, if necessary, Executive Orders of the President be issued and legislation be passed by the Congress to correct this intolerable situation.”</strong></p>
<p>This statement was signed by the <strong>National Association of Evangelicals</strong> and supported by multiple organizations, including the <strong>Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies</strong> and the <strong>Maryknoll Fathers and Sisters</strong>, among others.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years have passed since that hearing, and given significant events since—particularly the September 11 attacks—it seems overdue for a new public inquiry. So much has changed, including the evolution of technology, which now allows for much more sophisticated surveillance and intelligence methods.</p>
<p>Being a victim of a transnational criminal enterprise orchestrated from Chicago and now the victim of illegal surveillance by the U.S. intelligence community, I believe it&rsquo;s time to reopen the discussion on these methods. If we are truly to uphold the rule of law and ensure ethical intelligence practices, this debate must be brought into the public sphere once again, involving multiple nations and considering the new technological landscape.</p>
<h2 id="corporate-influence-in-us-foreign-policy-a-historical-investigation">Corporate Influence in U.S. Foreign Policy: A Historical Investigation</h2>
<p>Reflecting on this situation, I’m reminded of <strong>Constant Méheut</strong> and his colleagues’ article, “<strong>The Ransom: Invade Haiti, Wall Street Urged. The U.S. Obliged.</strong>” This piece effectively highlights historical patterns of U.S. intervention and corporate influence, raising important questions about the current dynamics between the U.S. intelligence community and American corporations in the 21st century.</p>
<h2 id="questions-about-us-legal-practices">Questions About U.S. Legal Practices</h2>
<h3 id="selective-enforcement-and-corporate-influence">Selective Enforcement and Corporate Influence</h3>
<p>The U.S. has enacted various laws with extraterritorial reach, but this raises important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does the Department of Justice (DOJ) enforce these laws as rigorously against American criminal organizations as it does against foreign ones?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there an inherent bias where the DOJ primarily targets foreign companies to ensure that &ldquo;America comes first&rdquo;?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the modern global economy, the ties between intelligence and corporate interests can be blurry. It&rsquo;s critical to scrutinize whether U.S. corporations are receiving preferential treatment under these extraterritorial laws. The real issue is whether justice is being served impartially or if the enforcement of these laws is selectively aimed at weakening international competitors while protecting domestic interests.</p>
<p>At times, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that the U.S. is beginning to resemble an authoritarian regime, much like China. While the U.S. has long championed democracy, freedom, and the rule of law, there are growing signs of control and surveillance that echo the practices of authoritarian states. The use of mass surveillance, intelligence overreach, and <em>seemingly</em> close ties between government and large corporations are troubling developments.</p>
<p>The increasing power of the U.S. intelligence community, especially when used in ways that infringe on personal privacy and civil liberties, feels eerily similar to the surveillance apparatus in China. What is more concerning is the growing influence of American corporations, which seem to operate above the law, <em>seemingly</em> protected by the same government institutions meant to regulate them. When the Department of Justice <em>appears</em> selective in its enforcement of laws, <em>seemingly</em> favoring U.S. entities over foreign competitors, it raises serious concerns about accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>These trends, combined with the erosion of free speech and the manipulation of information, make me question whether the U.S. is losing its commitment to democratic principles. In some ways, it feels like the lines between democracy and authoritarianism are becoming blurred, and I worry that the country I once looked to as a beacon of freedom is drifting toward a more controlled and repressive model of governance.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-action-against-mcdonalds-corporation-and-its-accomplices">The Need for Action Against McDonald’s Corporation and its Accomplices</h2>
<h3 id="a-call-for-dismantling-a-criminal-enterprise">A Call for Dismantling a Criminal Enterprise</h3>
<p>McDonald’s operates as a criminal, mafia-like organization that must be taken down and <em>completely</em> dismantled. The harm they have caused to society is already far too extensive to ignore. It&rsquo;s not just about fast food—it&rsquo;s about a corporation that has embedded itself deeply in global systems, using its influence to engage in fraudulent activities, evade accountability, and perpetuate harm on a massive scale.</p>
<p>People need to de-brainwash themselves from the idealized image of McDonald’s as a simple restaurant chain. The reality is that McDonald’s is a global criminal entity, driven by profit at any cost, even if it means knowingly breaking the law by engaging in mass-marketing frauds and money laundering. These are not the actions of a legitimate business; they are the actions of a well-organized, corrupt enterprise with little regard for the societies it profits from.</p>
<p>The time has come for the public to wake up and confront the truth about McDonald’s. We cannot allow this corporation to continue operating unchecked, protected by its corporate façade and marketing campaigns. It&rsquo;s time for authorities and the global community to take decisive action, dismantle this criminal network, and hold McDonald’s accountable for the damage they have caused.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
<h3 id="parliamentary-inquiry-and-investigation">Parliamentary Inquiry and Investigation</h3>
<p>I urge you to raise this issue in Parliament by engaging the following committees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligence and Security Committee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Home Affairs Committee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Treasury Committee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Justice Select Committee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Joint Committee on Human Rights</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I request that these committees initiate a thorough investigation into the allegations and hold public hearings to ensure transparency and accountability. Specifically, I ask that they:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigate Money Laundering Activities:</strong> Examine the extent of money laundering involving British companies, executives, and citizens, and assess their impact on national security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluate International Cooperation:</strong> Identify any shortcomings or misunderstandings that may have contributed to the lack of appropriate action by British authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure Transparency:</strong> Hold public hearings to facilitate open discussions, maintaining public trust and ensuring that findings are accessible, except for those that may need to be withheld for national security reasons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="personal-risk-and-human-rights-concerns">Personal Risk and Human Rights Concerns</h2>
<p>While the death penalty is theoretically possible in China, I believe it is less likely in our case because such an outcome would reflect exceptionally poorly on China. <span style="color:red">However, there is a significant risk of other serious human rights violations, including torture and inhuman or degrading treatment as defined under <span style="font-weight:bold">Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights</span>, as well as violations related to the right to a fair trial and the protection of family rights.</span></p>
<p>This situation has caused immense emotional and psychological distress. Swift action is essential to prevent further harm. I am deeply concerned for the safety and well-being of my loved ones; the threat to their lives has created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty for our family.</p>
<h2 id="importance-to-the-united-kingdom">Importance to the United Kingdom</h2>
<h3 id="upholding-international-commitments">Upholding International Commitments</h3>
<p>While I understand that your primary responsibility lies with your constituency, this case touches on the core of the UK&rsquo;s international commitments and national security obligations. As a member of the <strong>Council of Europe</strong>, the UK is committed to upholding principles of justice, transparency, and international cooperation, especially in matters involving cross-border criminal activities like money laundering.</p>
<p>Addressing this issue is in the UK&rsquo;s best interest—not only for the sake of justice but also to maintain trust with international partners and safeguard national security. Failure to act could have far-reaching consequences for the UK&rsquo;s reputation and diplomatic relationships.</p>
<h2 id="recent-developments-and-transparency-efforts">Recent Developments and Transparency Efforts</h2>
<p>On October 5, 2024, I copied you on an email I sent to French elected official <strong>Cédric Villani</strong>. This marked the first time, to my knowledge, that non-American citizens were granted access to a non-redacted version of my complaint filed with the U.S. DoD OIG in December 2023. While I had initially considered sending you a redacted version, I decided that this matter has gone on long enough, and it is time for the truth to come out.</p>
<p>In November 2022, the <strong>European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)</strong> granted me full anonymity to protect my identity. However, in August 2023, I temporarily waived this anonymity after officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing refused to meet with me when I sought to clarify statements made by [REDACTED] who is identified as <strong>Subject #1</strong> <em>in the redacted version</em> of my DoD OIG complaint that I submitted to the ECtHR.</p>
<p>By the end of 2023, I submitted multiple requests for interim measures to the ECtHR, including a request for the Court to adopt an inquisitorial procedure rather than an adversarial one in the proceedings against France to establish the facts.</p>
<p>Since filing these new requests, I have not received any response from the ECtHR, except for a regrettable and ironic attempt in April 2024, led by the Court’s own IT Department, to violate my freedom of speech—ironically one of the very rights the Court is meant to protect—by trying to shut down my website, <a href="https://www.ECtHRwatch.org"><strong>ECtHRwatch.org</strong></a>, through a Digital Millennium Copyright Act procedure. I filed a counter-notice with the hosting company, Amazon AWS, which ruled in my favor, allowing me to keep the website active.</p>
<p>As a former journalist for <em>The Financial Times</em>, I am sure you can appreciate the seriousness—and irony—of the ECtHR resorting to American laws to suppress public discourse within Europe.</p>
<p>I have begun submitting new requests to the ECtHR to unseal the Court’s records, making them accessible to the public and allowing journalists to review the non-redacted version of my DoD OIG complaint which the Court doesn’t have yet. Due to the ongoing lack of response—even in cases where a negative decision would require communication—I have increasingly published my communications as open letters. While I strive to redact sensitive information, the absence of formal responses has compelled me to publicly acknowledge the national security components of this case.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-response-from-authorities">Lack of Response from Authorities</h2>
<p>I fear that I may have been made aware of U.S. intelligence activities as part of an attempt to protect McDonald’s Corporation, which could itself be a form of blackmail. Depending on how the situation progresses, I may have no choice but to publish all information without redactions, including this open letter.</p>
<p>In this initial communication, I am addressing this letter solely to you. I plan to forward it to various officials, journalists, McDonald’s executives, and others as necessary, including executives of financial institutions such as Neuberger Berman CEO George Walker and Norges Bank Investment Management CEO Nicolai Tangen. A complete list of recipients and the reasons for their inclusion might be provided later.</p>
<p>My reasoning is straightforward: this approach will facilitate the work of journalists who are also copied on these messages, allowing them to investigate without needing to protect my identity. For example, by including McDonald’s Corporation in the correspondence, journalists can directly contact the company for comments on my allegations, making it harder for them to claim plausible deniability.</p>
<p>The same applies to officials from various countries. Once I forward this email to a wide range of individuals, nothing will prevent a journalist from contacting, for example, a <strong>U.S. Senator</strong>’s office for comment. Or even <strong>French elected official and Fields Medal Winner Cédric Villani</strong>, to whom I reached out in 2019 to bring attention to exceptionally serious crimes related to this case. These crimes go beyond those committed by McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices; they also involve the <strong>altering/doctoring/falsification of court/official/legal documents</strong> in the process of legal procedures targeting McDonald’s. Instead of offering help, Mr. Villani’s Director of Communication, Philippe Mouricou, issued threats against me—a fact Mr. Villani could not have been unaware of.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.</strong></p>
<p>I intend to follow up on this correspondence within two weeks if I do not receive a response.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Vincent B. Le Corre

        <span class="block pb-2">I am the key witness and whistleblower in the major criminal RICO case targeting McDonald’s Corporation and their accomplices for fraud, money laundering, and corruption of foreign officials and magistrates. Initially granted anonymity by the European Court of Human Rights (Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court), I made the decision in August 2023 to temporarily go public with my identity. This decision, driven by concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, was taken despite the potential risks, hoping it will be temporary only and that I can return to anonymity soon.</span>
