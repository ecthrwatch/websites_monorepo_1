## Other websites related to the McDonald's frauds cases

[ECtHRwatch - Official website](https://www.ECtHRwatch.org) : I will list all the cases I file with the European Court of Human Rights.

[Robert Spano (Robert-Spano.com)](https://www.Robert-Spano.com) : Róbert Ragnar Spanó, President of the European Court of Human Rights. Non-official website.

[Europe-v-McDonalds](https://www.europe-v-mcdonalds.org) : Open letters to officials and institutions of the European Union.

[Federal-Bureau-of-Investigation.com (NON-OFFICIAL)](https://www.Federal-Bureau-of-Investigation.com) : This is a non-official website about the F.B.I. on which I intend to openly publish my communications to them. McDonald's France has committed multiple counts of aggravated fraud. In 2015, I formally warned the U.S. executives working for McDonald's Corporation. They acknowledged taking the inquiry seriously but nevertheless failed to put an end to an ongoing aggravated fraud which was then taking place in Europe. I believe RICO charged could be brought against them.
