            "description": "In my recent email to the FBI, I stress the importance of understanding key probability concepts—specifically, the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions. This distinction is vital in dissecting the fraudulent activities of McDonald’s in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I reference a flawed article by journalist Walter Hickey to illustrate common misconceptions, while also highlighting the accurate definition of probability as given by David Morin from Harvard University. My expectation is that FBI and Justice Department agents not only grasp the fundamental concept of probability, but also recognize the impact of the number of trials in a Binomial distribution on the outcome. This understanding is crucial for unraveling the complexities of the case at hand.",

I express urgency for the FBI and the Justice Department to grasp the nuanced distinction between an element and a set, a foundational concept that underpins the sophisticated mechanics of the crimes in question. Amidst my call for clarity and action, I also convey my anticipation for a response regarding the lead investigator of the racketeering case, hinting at the necessity to involve oversight agencies should the silence persist.

I express my concerns regarding the fraudulent nature of the game’s probability calculations, particularly the assertion of having “1 chance out of 4” to win. I argue that, in reality, the odds were closer to “1 chance out of 8,” a figure never stated by the corporation. My goal is to demonstrate the fraud in their probability claims and to clarify the real chances of winning based on a single game stamp. I urge Mr. Rogalski (State Department/FBI) to ensure the FBI is aware of these issues, as they have ramifications in numerous countries. I urge the FBI to alert INTERPOL.

            "description": "In my correspondence with Mr. Adam Rogalski, Assistant Legal Attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, I delve into my longstanding belief that the U.S. version of the McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes constitutes an illegal lottery. Citing a detailed explanation on a website, I argue that the promotion’s claim of “NO PURCHASE NECESSARY” is misleading, as statistical analysis suggests that participating without a purchase might be more costly than the prizes offered. Additionally, I challenge the assertion that “PURCHASE WILL NOT IMPROVE CHANCES OF WINNING.” I propose that, theoretically, a wealthy enough individual could secure all prizes by purchasing all game stamps, thereby guaranteeing victory, which contradicts McDonald’s claim. These inconsistencies, I believe, point towards fraudulent practices. I also suggest the FBI question former McDonald’s executive Gloria Santona, as her departure timing might be significant. My aim is to highlight the potential deception in this widely known sweepstakes and the need for thorough investigation.",

I discuss the deceptive nature of their promotional strategy, specifically pointing out how their “1 chance out of 4” per attempt claim in their instant-win game misled me. This, I argue, is a clear case of mass marketing fraud driven by greed, designed to artificially boost sales. I question why McDonald’s chose not to state a straightforward “1 chance out of 8.” I emphasize the importance of upholding the law consistently, especially when it comes to large corporations, and express my concerns about the broader implications of such fraudulent practices on the integrity of financial systems. My correspondence serves as a call to action for the FBI to investigate these practices, which I believe are part of a larger pattern of criminal activity by McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices.",

I reference the explanation I provided to New York Times journalist Constant Méheut about the instant-win fraud in France for 2011, asserting its relevance to the U.S. operations of McDonald’s in 2013. I emphasize the significance of McDonald’s fraudulent claim of “one-in-four odds of winning” for their 2013 U.S. promotion, critically analyzing the calculation basis they provided and highlighting the deviation from their stated odds. This correspondence serves as a stark reminder of the serious implications of these allegations, particularly when they involve targeting children, and questions the integrity of McDonald’s practices.

    <h3 class="mt-0">Clarifying Probability Concepts for the FBI Investigation : the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my recent email to the FBI, I stress the importance of understanding key probability concepts—specifically, the difference between “the probability of a certain scenario happening,” Bernoulli trials, and Binomial distributions. This distinction is vital in dissecting the fraudulent activities of McDonald’s in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I reference a flawed article by journalist Walter Hickey to illustrate common misconceptions, while also highlighting the accurate definition of probability as given by David Morin from Harvard University. My expectation is that FBI and Justice Department agents not only grasp the fundamental concept of probability, but also recognize the impact of the number of trials in a Binomial distribution on the outcome. This understanding is crucial for unraveling the complexities of the case at hand.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my email to the FBI, I aim to shed light on the set theory and its pertinence to the FBI’s investigation of McDonald’s Corporation’s criminal activities. I express urgency for the FBI and the Justice Department to grasp the nuanced distinction between an element and a set, a foundational concept that underpins the sophisticated mechanics of the crimes in question. Amidst my call for clarity and action, I also convey my anticipation for a response regarding the lead investigator of the racketeering case, hinting at the necessity to involve oversight agencies should the silence persist. My message underscores the critical need for understanding mathematical principles in unraveling the intricacies of the serious crimes committed by the transnational crimal entity McDonald’s Corporation.<br>

    In my correspondence with the FBI, I confront a pressing question: “Is McDonald’s Corporation too big to fail?” I question the U.S. government’s resolve in tackling the crimes committed by one of the world’s largest corporations. My email seeks to understand the progress of the investigation and Mr. Rogalski’s involvement. I offer to clarify any complexities he might face and urge for a response. This message is a direct appeal for action and transparency, aiming to shed light on the potential impunity of a corporate giant and the need for accountability in the face of significant global implications.<br>

    In my email to Mr. Adam Rogalski, I address significant concerns about money laundering and fraud within McDonald’s Corporation, particularly emphasizing the roles of Malcolm Hicks and Steve Easterbrook. I point out the clear violation of the European Directive 2005/29/CE by McDonald’s, focusing on the deceptive practices in their promotions across different countries. This message to the FBI calls for an urgent and thorough investigation into these serious allegations, underscoring the necessity of immediate action and accountability for what I describe as clear instances of organized crime within a major RICO framework. My correspondence is a demand for justice and a comprehensive response from legal and governmental authorities in the face of these substantial allegations.<br>

  </a>
  
    In my correspondence with the FBI, I delve into the intricate details of McDonald’s Corporation’s fraudulent claims in their Monopoly sweepstakes. I express my concerns regarding the fraudulent nature of the game’s probability calculations, particularly the assertion of having “1 chance out of 4” to win. I argue that, in reality, the odds were closer to “1 chance out of 8,” a figure never stated by the corporation. My goal is to demonstrate the fraud in their probability claims and to clarify the real chances of winning based on a single game stamp. I urge Mr. Rogalski (State Department/FBI) to ensure the FBI is aware of these issues, as they have ramifications in numerous countries. I urge the FBI to alert INTERPOL. This email is an attempt to unravel the complexities of the situation, seeking clarity and accountability in one of the largest fraud cases in history.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Crucial Evidence: Gloria Santona’s Contact in 2016 Revealed</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my email to Mr. Rogalski, I provide critical evidence of Gloria Santona’s contact with me in 2016. The attached screenshots reveal her following me on Twitter, opening a direct communication channel through DM. This interaction suggests McDonald’s awareness of the frauds. I urge the FBI to acknowledge receipt and identify the lead agent for the criminal investigation into the racketeering enterprise. The silence from law enforcement is disconcerting, and I seek clarity on these serious allegations.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">In the United States, did the McDonald’s Monopoly Sweepstakes constitute an illegal lottery?</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my correspondence with Mr. Adam Rogalski, Assistant Legal Attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, I delve into my longstanding belief that the U.S. version of the McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes constitutes an illegal lottery. Citing a detailed explanation on a website, I argue that the promotion’s claim of “NO PURCHASE NECESSARY” is misleading, as statistical analysis suggests that participating without a purchase might be more costly than the prizes offered. Additionally, I challenge the assertion that “PURCHASE WILL NOT IMPROVE CHANCES OF WINNING.” I propose that, theoretically, a wealthy enough individual could secure all prizes by purchasing all game stamps, thereby guaranteeing victory, which contradicts McDonald’s claim. These inconsistencies, I believe, point towards fraudulent practices. I also suggest the FBI question former McDonald’s executive Gloria Santona, as her departure timing might be significant. My aim is to highlight the potential deception in this widely known sweepstakes and the need for thorough investigation.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Urging the FBI to Investigate McDonald’s for Fraudulent Practices</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my email to the FBI, I highlight the need for a thorough investigation into McDonald’s Corporation for their fraudulent practices. I discuss the deceptive nature of their promotional strategy, specifically pointing out how their “1 chance out of 4” per attempt claim in their instant-win game misled me. This, I argue, is a clear case of mass marketing fraud driven by greed, designed to artificially boost sales. I question why McDonald’s chose not to state a straightforward “1 chance out of 8.” I emphasize the importance of upholding the law consistently, especially when it comes to large corporations, and express my concerns about the broader implications of such fraudulent practices on the integrity of financial systems. My correspondence serves as a call to action for the FBI to investigate these practices, which I believe are part of a larger pattern of criminal activity by McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices.<br>

    <h3 class="mt-0">Exposing RICO Violations by McDonald’s to the FBI</h3>
  </a>
  
    In my email to the FBI, I detail the racketeering activity within McDonald’s Corporation, specifically in the context of the United States. I reference the explanation I provided to New York Times journalist Constant Méheut about the instant-win fraud in France for 2011, asserting its relevance to the U.S. operations of McDonald’s in 2013. I emphasize the significance of McDonald’s fraudulent claim of “one-in-four odds of winning” for their 2013 U.S. promotion, critically analyzing the calculation basis they provided and highlighting the deviation from their stated odds. This correspondence serves as a stark reminder of the serious implications of these allegations, particularly when they involve targeting children, and questions the integrity of McDonald’s practices. I express concern over the security of my personal information and communications, seeking the FBI’s attention and action in a case that I argue has deep legal and ethical ramifications.<br>
