On January 25, 2019, at 00h44 (China Standard Time), I sent an email to, among other people, Nicole Belloubet, François Molins, Rémy Heitz, Hélène Davo, and Emmanuel Macron. In this email, I alerted them about the critical dysfunctions of the French judicial system.</description>

      <description>Note: this email has been redacted for brevity. Check the French version of this page for the full content.
Key point: French law professor Yves Strickler didn&amp;rsquo;t disapprove the possibility for me to do a hunger strike to protest the repeated violations of my fundamental rights by France. For the record, I am now accusing McDonald’s of having corrupted French officials. It might help to explain why McDonald’s France and McDonald’s Corporation, and their accomplices, have never been indicted for serious fraud and money laundering in France.</description>

To: Nicole Belloubet
On October 23, 2018, at 20:06, I formally notified French Minister of Justice Nicole Belloubet about the grave incident at the Legal Aid Office of the Versailles Court. This office had intentionally altered a date to unjustly dismiss my appeal against McDonald&amp;rsquo;s France and one of their accomplices, thus committing a serious crime under French law.</description>
