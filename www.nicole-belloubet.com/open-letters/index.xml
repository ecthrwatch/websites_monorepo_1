On January 25, 2019, at 00h44 (China Standard Time), I sent an email to, among other people, Nicole Belloubet, François Molins, Rémy Heitz, Hélène Davo, and Emmanuel Macron. In this email, I alerted them about the critical dysfunctions of the French judicial system. I also provided 7 concrete examples of the serious crime of faux en écriture publique, the falsification/doctoring/altering/forging of a court/public/official/legal document/decision, under articles 441-1 and 441-4 of the French criminal code.</description>

Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2017-07-04_1733_0800_yves_strickler.pdf Email from Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, confirming to me that procedural contracts are invented by the French bar associations, French jurisdictions, and French legal aid offices (BAJ - Bureaux d&amp;rsquo;Aide Juridictionnelle), and that this is something truly preposterous! That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it.</description>

Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2017-07-04_0142_0800_reply_from_law_professor_yves_strickler.pdf I had written to Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, to ask him if, in his opinion, my request for provisional admission to legal aid was admissible. He confirms that my request for provisional admission to legal aid appears to be admissible. Moreover, he is surprised that I have not initiated summary proceedings in my employment case in which I was dismissed in 2010 for striking.</description>
