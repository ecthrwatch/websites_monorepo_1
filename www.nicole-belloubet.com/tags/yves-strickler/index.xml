Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2017-07-04_1733_0800_yves_strickler.pdf Email from Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, confirming to me that procedural contracts are invented by the French bar associations, French jurisdictions, and French legal aid offices (BAJ - Bureaux d&amp;rsquo;Aide Juridictionnelle), and that this is something truly preposterous! That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it.</description>

He confirms that my request for provisional admission to legal aid appears to be admissible. Moreover, he is surprised that I have not initiated summary proceedings in my employment case in which I was dismissed in 2010 for striking.</description>
