      <description>Who am I? On February 16, 2023, I received formal notification from the European Court of Human Rights that my request for anonymity (under Rules 33 and 47 of the Rules of Court) was accepted. However, in August 2023, due to concerns for my own safety and that of my loved ones, I made the difficult decision to temporarily go public with my identity.
My efforts to alert the FBI about the activities of McDonald’s Corporation began in earnest in 2015 and intensified from September 2021, with a significant increase in these efforts starting in September 2022.</description>

      <description>Who am I? On February 16, 2023, I was formally notified that the European Court of Human Rights agreed to accept my request for anonymity. Therefore, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about me. I want to talk about the crimes McDonald’s Corporation and their accomplices have committed over the years. I want to talk about what the judicial authorities are doing to bring McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices to justice.
I am currently actively notifying the American authorities.</description>
