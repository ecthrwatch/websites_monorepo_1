Dear Mr. Kempczinski,
Is Mr. Ozan‚Äôs departure related to the criminal RICO case targeting McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation and if yes, to which extent is it related? (look at the screenshot üëá to understand)
You also mention Mr. Ozan‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering integrity,‚Äù could you please confirm he reported internally my stern warnings about the crimes McDonald‚Äôs is engaging into?
As the CFO, he obviously should have understood McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation is engaging in money laundering, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he?</description>

      <title>Hunger Strike. Reply from French Law Professor Yves Strickler</title>

      <description>Note: this email has been redacted for brevity. Check the French version of this page for the full content.
Key point: French law professor Yves Strickler didn&amp;rsquo;t disapprove the possibility for me to do a hunger strike to protest the repeated violations of my fundamental rights by France. For the record, I am now accusing McDonald‚Äôs of having corrupted French officials. It might help to explain why McDonald‚Äôs France and McDonald‚Äôs Corporation, and their accomplices, have never been indicted for serious fraud and money laundering in France.</description>

Ms Santona,
Thank you for answering me. Could you please make sure the French team communicate with me by email? Normal mail takes forever for me to receive now that I live in China and I am not going to wait one month to act if there is an ongoing fraud.</description>

      <description>This book contains a crucial evidence that McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation executives could have easily, through a simple phone call, stop the ongoing frauds which were happening in France, and later in Europe.
Then, why didn&amp;rsquo;t they?
In addition to the fact that there is an undeniable proof that, contrarily to what Gloria Santona said, this was a French problem, the book offers additional insights about how McDonald&amp;rsquo;s seems to corrupt politicians.
To gain a clearer understanding of the sequence of events in this case, I invite you to view a detailed timeline at the following link:</description>

&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, a copy of the mail was sent to a French Ministerial Officer who I now accuse of being corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation coming soon. (Note of 2023-04-13: quick note, this event happened in 2012 and I published it, if I am not mistaken, on 2022-09-21T20:49:00+08:00. Back then I wrote ‚Äútranslation coming soon‚Äù but I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have time to translate what was said in French. It&amp;rsquo;s an important event but not that important compared to what I am currently explaining to the FBI which is the priority.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fran√ßoise de Borda, directrice juridique de McDonald‚Äôs France, me r√©ponds pour la premi√®re et pour la derni√®re fois. Elle ment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
