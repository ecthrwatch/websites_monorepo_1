  </a>
  
    In an email I sent to the FBI, I draw a stark comparison between McDonald’s Corporation and disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong. This page reveals my insights on how small, criminally obtained advantages, when systematically exploited, can lead to substantial and unfair dominance in the business world. My analogy strikingly positions McDonald’s marketing tactics alongside Armstrong’s infamous career, offering a unique perspective on the deceptive and illegal strategies that underlie the success of this global fast-food leader.<br>

  </a>
  
    I send an email to Gloria Santona, General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation, warning her that the U.S. executive team could be charged as an accessory after the fact for the ongoing serious fraud currently taking place in France. I remind them what the European Union law says. Email CCed to multiple executives in the United States and in France.<br>
