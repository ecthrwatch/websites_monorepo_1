Dear Ms. Ralls-Morrison,
I recently came across a LinkedIn post announcing your upcoming receipt of the CCWC 2024 Diamond Award of Excellence in Las Vegas at the Bellagio, as quoted by Ms. Laurie N. Robinson Haden. While many have extended their congratulations, I find myself in a position of contemplation rather than celebration.</description>

To: Donald Alway (Assistant Director in Charge, FBI)
Dear Mr. Don Alway, thank you for sharing the message of Director Wray. I watched it with genuine interest. I sincerely hope the FBI doesn’t underestimate the harm done by white-collar criminals. Director Wray omitted to mention financial crime but financial crimes often end up causing very significant harm to society including lots of premature deaths.</description>

      <description>Click this link to see the original LinkedIn post.
Dear Mr. Kempczinski,
Is Mr. Ozan’s departure related to the criminal RICO case targeting McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation and if yes, to which extent is it related? (look at the screenshot 👇 to understand)
You also mention Mr. Ozan’s “unwavering integrity,” could you please confirm he reported internally my stern warnings about the crimes McDonald’s is engaging into?
As the CFO, he obviously should have understood McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation is engaging in money laundering, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he?</description>

I’ve decided to also launch the website Steve-Easterbrook.com
The purpose of this website is to highlight the hypocrisy between your officials speeches/interviews and the way you truly run McDonald’s Corporation.
Indeed, I believe it’s full of hypocrisy to pretend you want to become a change agent for good while you don’t do anything to cease a massive and major fraud.</description>

Dear Mr. Easterbrook, dear Ms. Santona, and dear Mr. Hicks,
I repeat again. Please stop the fraud. You must make it stop!
I know you know this “game” is a fraud under European laws. You can not possibly be so stupid not to understand except if you don’t understand on purpose so that you can later claim plausible deniability.</description>

Thank you for answering me. Could you please make sure the French team communicate with me by email? Normal mail takes forever for me to receive now that I live in China and I am not going to wait one month to act if there is an ongoing fraud.</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

      <description>Around January 2023, I found out that McDonald’s Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald’s Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald’s Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.
