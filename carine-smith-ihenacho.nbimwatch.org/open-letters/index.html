    <h3 class="mt-0">Crime report sent by email, to among other people, Nicole Belloubet, François Molins, Rémy Heitz, Hélène Davo, and Emmanuel Macron</h3>
  </a>
  
    On January 25, 2019, I sent an email to, among other people, Nicole Belloubet, François Molins, Rémy Heitz, Hélène Davo, and Emmanuel Macron. In this email, I alerted them to the serious dysfunctions of the French judicial system. I also provided 7 concrete examples of the serious crime of falsification/doctoring/altering/forging of a court/public/official/legal document/decision, under articles 441-1 and 441-4 of the French criminal code. I alerted them that there are at least several billion euros in fines to be imposed on the McDonald&#39;s group.

  </a>
  
    On October 23, 2018, at 20:06, I formally notified French Minister of Justice Nicole Belloubet about the grave incident at the Legal Aid Office of the Versailles Court. This office had intentionally altered a date to unjustly dismiss my appeal against McDonald&#39;s France and one of their accomplices, thus committing a serious crime under French law. Minister Belloubet might also have committed a crime if she neglected to follow-up on my report.

  </a>
  
    Email from Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, confirming to me that procedural contracts are invented by the bar associations, the jurisdictions, and the legal aid offices, and that this is something truly preposterous! That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it. In essence, this situation amounts to the judicial branch circumventing the legislative branch to create its own laws, a practice that is profoundly dangerous. It undermines the principle of the separation of powers, a cornerstone of democratic governance.
