Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

      <title>McDonald’s Corporation v. Simon Marketing 2002-09-16</title>
      <link>https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/mcdonalds-corporation-v-simons-marketing-2002-09-16/</link>

      <description>I had heard about this very old story between McDonald’s Corporation and one of their suppliers in 2020 or 2021 if I recall correctly. However, and if I recall correctly still, it&amp;rsquo;s only recently (probably January 2023), that I found out this piece of evidence which proves that McDonald’s Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald’s Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald’s Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.</description>

      <link>https://www.ecthrwatch.org/evidence/mcdonalds-v-simons-2002-09-16/</link>

      <description>Key takeaway: McDonald’s Corporation and its executives knew perfectly well, in 2015, that McDonald’s Corporation and its subsidiary companies were engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.
“MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
MATTHEW F. KENNELLY, United States District Judge.
[…]
McDonald&amp;rsquo;s asserts seven claims against the defendants. Counts 1 and 2 are claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against Jacobson and the other individual defendants, charging them with conducting Simon&amp;rsquo;s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiring to do so.</description>
