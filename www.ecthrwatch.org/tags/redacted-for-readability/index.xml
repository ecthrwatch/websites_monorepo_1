      <description>Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

Dear Ms. Santona,
I am surprised that the French website carrying the fraud hasn’t been taken down yet. I do believe that the U.S. executive team can legally be held responsible and be accessory after the facts for this massive fraud.</description>
