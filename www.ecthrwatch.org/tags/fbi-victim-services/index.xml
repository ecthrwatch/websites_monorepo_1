      <description>On February 15, 2023, I tried to call a phone number I found on an FBI brochure related to the FBI Victim Services. The phone number was (202)-324-3000.
But the FBI operator hanged up on me.
After the FBI informed me the FBI was recording the phone call, I informed the operator that I was also recording the phone call and he disagreed so he hanged up.</description>
