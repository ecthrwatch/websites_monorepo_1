      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012.</description>

      <title>McDonald’s Corporation v. Simon Marketing 2002-09-16</title>

      <description>Around January 2023, I found out that McDonald’s Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald’s Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald’s Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.

      <description>Key takeaway: McDonald’s Corporation and its executives knew perfectly well, in 2015, that McDonald’s Corporation and its subsidiary companies were engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.
“MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
MATTHEW F. KENNELLY, United States District Judge.
[…]
McDonald&amp;rsquo;s asserts seven claims against the defendants. Counts 1 and 2 are claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against Jacobson and the other individual defendants, charging them with conducting Simon&amp;rsquo;s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiring to do so.</description>
