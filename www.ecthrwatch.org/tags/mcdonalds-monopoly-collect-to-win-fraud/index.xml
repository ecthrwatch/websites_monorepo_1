      <description>READ THIS FIRST IF YOU HAVEN&amp;rsquo;T READ IT YET
“Pattern of racketeering activity” requires at least two acts of racketeering activity committed within ten years of each other. 18 U.S. Code § 1961(5).
McDonald’s Corporation and its subsidiary companies, and their accomplices, have engaged in, and/or condoned, a pattern of racketeering activity.
This is the perfect example to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the executives of McDonald’s Corporation, like Steve Easterbrook, or Kevin Ozan, or Gloria Santona, just to name a few, and the executives of its subsidiary companies, like Malcolm Hicks, or Nawfal Trabelsi, or Françoise de Borda, just to name a few, couldn&amp;rsquo;t have reasonably ignored that they were running a criminal enterprise through serious fraud, targetting even children, and money laundering.</description>
