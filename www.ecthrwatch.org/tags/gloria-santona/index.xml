THIS EMAIL CONTAINS WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE VERY IMPORTANT LEGAL INFORMATION. DON’T DISREGARD IT!
Dear Sir or Madam,
This a formal notice to warn you that your McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes in the United States actually qualifies, to the best of my knowledge, as an illegal lottery!</description>

SUBJECT: defamation against my consumer protection websites
DATE: December 8, 2016 at 00:05 (Beijing time +0800)
TO : Gloria.Santona@us.mcd.com, Steve.Easterbrook@us.mcd.com, Malcolm.Hicks@eu.mcd.com
I forgot to mention…
As for me, I am going to file a lawsuit against “X” (but targeting McDonald’s) for, among other things, defamation. Indeed, it seems some of your executives were behind some defamatory comment against my websites.</description>

To: Steve Easterbrook, Gloria Santona, Malcolm Hicks
Dear Mr. Easterbrook, dear Ms. Santona, and dear Mr. Hicks,
I repeat again. Please stop the fraud. You must make it stop!
I know you know this “game” is a fraud under European laws. You can not possibly be so stupid not to understand except if you don’t understand on purpose so that you can later claim plausible deniability.</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

      <description>Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>
