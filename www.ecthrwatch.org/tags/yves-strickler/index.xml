Dear Professor Strickler,
Thank you for reminding me to pay close attention to compliance. You are absolutely right!
Please don’t worry if you don’t immediately have the time to read all of the emails I am CCing to you regarding the pattern of racketeering activity McDonald’s Corporation has engaged into.</description>

      <description>Note: this email has been redacted for brevity. Check the French version of this page for the full content.
Key point: French law professor Yves Strickler didn&amp;rsquo;t disapprove the possibility for me to do a hunger strike to protest the repeated violations of my fundamental rights by France. For the record, I am now accusing McDonald’s of having corrupted French officials. It might help to explain why McDonald’s France and McDonald’s Corporation, and their accomplices, have never been indicted for serious fraud and money laundering in France.</description>

Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2017-07-04_1733_0800_yves_strickler.pdf Email from Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, confirming to me that procedural contracts are invented by the French bar associations, French jurisdictions, and French legal aid offices (BAJ - Bureaux d&amp;rsquo;Aide Juridictionnelle), and that this is something truly preposterous! That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it.</description>

Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2017-07-04_0142_0800_reply_from_law_professor_yves_strickler.pdf I had written to Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, to ask him if, in his opinion, my request for provisional admission to legal aid was admissible. He confirms that my request for provisional admission to legal aid appears to be admissible. Moreover, he is surprised that I have not initiated summary proceedings in my employment case in which I was dismissed in 2010 for striking.</description>
