I forgot to mention…
As for me, I am going to file a lawsuit against “X” (but targeting McDonald’s) for, among other things, defamation. Indeed, it seems some of your executives were behind some defamatory comment against my websites. One such comment was saying that my website was the fraud.</description>

Dear Mr. Easterbrook, dear Ms. Santona, and dear Mr. Hicks,
I repeat again. Please stop the fraud. You must make it stop!
I know you know this “game” is a fraud under European laws. You can not possibly be so stupid not to understand except if you don’t understand on purpose so that you can later claim plausible deniability.</description>

Ms Santona,
Thank you for answering me. Could you please make sure the French team communicate with me by email? Normal mail takes forever for me to receive now that I live in China and I am not going to wait one month to act if there is an ongoing fraud.
Please don’t be offended, but I think it is unwise to only ask the French team, the very people who I accuse of committing a criminal fraud, to review the situation.</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

Dear Ms. Santona,
I am surprised that the French website carrying the fraud hasn’t been taken down yet. I do believe that the U.S. executive team can legally be held responsible and be accessory after the facts for this massive fraud.</description>

Ms. Santona,
First of all, I want to thank you for having taken my phone call today without hanging up on me right away. Your counter-part in France, Mme de Borda, always refused to communicate with me through phone. Therefore, I greatly appreciate the fact you’ve listened to what I had to say, really.</description>

Page 15, out of 64, states that “Gloria Santona, 64, is Corporate Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, a position she has held since July 2003. Ms. Santona has been with the Company for 37 years.” (I emphasize)

      <description>Around January 2023, I found out that McDonald’s Corporation sued their supplier under RICO.
It&amp;rsquo;s an important piece of evidence because it proves that when I would keep notifying, in 2015, McDonald’s Corporation, sternly warning them that they were committing fraud, they could only have immediately understood that the roles were now reversed: McDonald’s Corporation was now the criminal and they were engaging, via their subsidiary companies, in a pattern of racketeering activity.

      <description>Key takeaway: McDonald’s Corporation and its executives knew perfectly well, in 2015, that McDonald’s Corporation and its subsidiary companies were engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.
“MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
MATTHEW F. KENNELLY, United States District Judge.
[…]
McDonald&amp;rsquo;s asserts seven claims against the defendants. Counts 1 and 2 are claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against Jacobson and the other individual defendants, charging them with conducting Simon&amp;rsquo;s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiring to do so.</description>
