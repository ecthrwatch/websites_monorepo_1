      <description>Foreword to the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (2011 ed.) â€œOur core mission is to pursue justice for criminal acts, and that pursuit includes justice for the victims of and witnesses to crime. Every day, Department personnel encounter individuals harmed by crime or who witnessed others being harmed by crime. How we treat those indi- viduals has a huge impact on their confidence in the criminal justice system and their ability to heal and recover from crime.</description>
