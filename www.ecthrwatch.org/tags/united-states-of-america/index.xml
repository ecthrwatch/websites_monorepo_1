      <description>Federal Bureau of Investigation I am going to seek Victim Assistance (White-Collar Crime (aggravated consumer fraud by McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation and/or its affiliated companies plus money laundering), also victim of Cyber Crime (Computer Intrusion)) and witness protection from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I am going to explain in further details why later.
I also intend to ask for witness protection to the European Court of Human Rights and to the Chinese Central Government.
You can read my open letters to the F.</description>

      <description>United States Department of State Check carefully who monitors the F.B.I. since Christopher Asher WRAY declared, if I am not mistaken, that he had a financial stake in McDonalds Corporation. Possible conflict of interests.
Therefore, just to be safe, I should also notify other officials. It’s one of the biggest fraud in history. We can’t leave anything to chance.
For the sake of transparency, open letters to Mr. Wray will be published on Christopher-Asher-Wray.com.</description>
