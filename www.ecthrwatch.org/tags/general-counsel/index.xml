SUBJECT: additional frauds
Ms Santona,
Thank you for answering me. Could you please make sure the French team communicate with me by email? Normal mail takes forever for me to receive now that I live in China and I am not going to wait one month to act if there is an ongoing fraud.
Please don’t be offended, but I think it is unwise to only ask the French team, the very people who I accuse of committing a criminal fraud, to review the situation.</description>

SUBJECT: Re: update
Thanks for your follow-up note. Of course, we take such inquiries seriously. As this is a French matter, I have asked the French team to review the situation and respond to you once they have shared their findings with me. The details are being checked in an expeditious manner and no delay is anticipated.
Best Regards,</description>

      <description>Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

Dear Ms. Santona,
I am surprised that the French website carrying the fraud hasn’t been taken down yet. I do believe that the U.S. executive team can legally be hold responsible and be accessory after the facts for this massive fraud.</description>

Ms. Santona,
First of all, I want to thank you for having taken my phone call today without hanging up on me right away. Your counter-part in France, Mme de Borda, always refused to communicate with me through phone.</description>
