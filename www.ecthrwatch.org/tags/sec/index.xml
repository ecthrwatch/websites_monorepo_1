      <description>THIS IS BEING UPDATED; PLEASE COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS. I ADDED THIS ENTRY ON JANUARY 20, 2023. I WILL TRY TO ADD MORE INFORMATION SOON. SOME IMPORTANT NAMES ARE NOT INCLUDED YET IN THE LIST I SUBMITTED TO THE SEC, LIKE WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINAL NAWFAL TRABELSI. IT&amp;rsquo;S IMPORTANT SINCE I REALIZED LAST WEEK-END THAT NAWFAL TRABELSI AND MALCOLM HICKS WERE BOTH MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF THE DIRECTORS OF MCDONALD&amp;rsquo;S IN FRANCE. I ALSO FOUND OUT STEVE EASTERBROOK HAD SOME TIES WITH SOME MCDONALD&amp;rsquo;S ENTITY IN FRANCE.</description>
