I forgot to mention…
As for me, I am going to file a lawsuit against “X” (but targeting McDonald’s) for, among other things, defamation. Indeed, it seems some of your executives were behind some defamatory comment against my websites. One such comment was saying that my website was the fraud.</description>

Dear Mr. Easterbrook, dear Ms. Santona, and dear Mr. Hicks,
I repeat again. Please stop the fraud. You must make it stop!
I know you know this “game” is a fraud under European laws. You can not possibly be so stupid not to understand except if you don’t understand on purpose so that you can later claim plausible deniability.</description>

Ms Santona,
Thank you for answering me. Could you please make sure the French team communicate with me by email? Normal mail takes forever for me to receive now that I live in China and I am not going to wait one month to act if there is an ongoing fraud.</description>

      <description>KEY POINT OF THIS EVENT: By acknowledging that McDonald’s Corporation executives “take such inquiries seriously”, McDonald’s Corporation can&amp;rsquo;t claim plausible deniability anymore. Furthermore, the email from Ms. Santona who is the General Counsel of McDonald’s Corporation is CCed to the CEO of McDonald’s Corporation Steve Easterbrook.

Ms. Santona,
I would like to give a friendly reminder that I gave McDonald’s a deadline of October 22nd 2015 midnight GMT time. So you have about 36 hours left. It was 4 entire days which is more than enough considering I’ve sent my first cease and desist letter back in 2012. On top of this, had I known that the French branch had started scamming people again, I would have at the time only given you 24 to 48 hours.</description>

Dear Ms. Santona,
I am surprised that the French website carrying the fraud hasn’t been taken down yet. I do believe that the U.S. executive team can legally be held responsible and be accessory after the facts for this massive fraud.</description>

Ms. Santona,
First of all, I want to thank you for having taken my phone call today without hanging up on me right away. Your counter-part in France, Mme de Borda, always refused to communicate with me through phone. Therefore, I greatly appreciate the fact you’ve listened to what I had to say, really.</description>
