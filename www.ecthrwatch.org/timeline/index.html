<h2>McDonald’s timelines:</h2>
<br>
<br>
McDonald’s <a href="/timeline/mcdonalds/">key takeaways timeline</a>: an extremely succint timeline.<br>
<br>
McDonald’s <a href="/timeline/mcdonalds-important-events-timeline/">important events timeline</a>: most important events and key developments in the case targeting McDonald’s Corporation for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.<br>
<br>
McDonald’s <a href="/timeline/mcdonalds-full-timeline/">full timeline</a>: despite its name, as of February 26, 2023, I haven't had the time yet to enter all of the events which happened until now. Far from it. My priority is to alert the U.S. authorities. There are therefore elements the FBI and the SEC were alerted about and which don't appear in this timeline.
<br>
<br>
<a href="/timeline/cases_all_events_all_importance_all/">Timeline of all events, of all importance, of all of the cases.</a><br>
<br>
I will later add more timelines.
