            <a href="https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/exposing-mcdonalds-1-in-4-frauds-through-binomial-distribution-statistical-analysis/"><span style="color: red">February 10, 2023</span> In one of my analysis, I uncover the truth behind McDonald’s “1 in 4” odds in their Monopoly sweepstakes. Through a binomial distribution approach, I demonstrate the vast disparity between the claimed and actual probabilities of winning, with real odds ranging from 1 in 1,000 to a staggering 1 in 10 billion. This investigation highlights a systematic pattern of mass-marketing fraud within McDonald’s promotions. I call for immediate action from the U.S. Department of Justice to address these criminal practices that significantly skew market competition and defraud consumers worldwide.</a>
        </li>
    
        <li>
            
            <a href="https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/explanation-to-the-fbi-simple-probability-vs-binomial-distribution-probability/"><span style="color: red">February 10, 2023</span> In my correspondence with the FBI, I elucidate the critical distinctions between simple probability and binomial distribution probability, highlighting the substantial implications these differences have in the context of this mass-marketing fraud case affecting many countries around the world. I argue that without explicit clarification, consumers, including minors, were inevitably defrauded by the criminal practices of the corporate predator that McDonald’s Corporation is. This fraudulent misrepresentation of chances of winning as simple probability, when they are in fact outcomes of a complex binomial probability, underscores my appeal for witness protection in the face of such powerful entities operating akin to a crime syndicate.</a>

            <a href="https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/fbi-i-want-to-help-you-understand-one-of-the-biggest-frauds-in-history/"><span style="color: red">February 7, 2023</span> I tell Assistant Legal Attaché Adam Rogalski, one of the FBI representatives in Beijing, that I want to help him, and by extension the FBI, to understand one of the biggest frauds in history.</a>
        </li>

            <a href="https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/fbi-exposing-mcdonalds-frauds-armstrong-comparison-2023-01-30/"><span style="color: red">January 30, 2023</span> In an email I sent to the FBI, I draw a stark comparison between McDonald’s Corporation and disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong. This page reveals my insights on how small, criminally obtained advantages, when systematically exploited, can lead to substantial and unfair dominance in the business world. My analogy strikingly positions McDonald’s marketing tactics alongside Armstrong’s infamous career, offering a unique perspective on the deceptive and illegal strategies that underlie the success of this global fast-food leader.</a>

I would forward their reply to Cédric Villani, a member of the French Parliament. The internal investigation targeting Steve Easterbrook would start about 1 week after this email I received from Anticor. Coincidence? Maybe. But it’s a fact that there is parallel truth which was happening at the same time. I personally don’t think it’s a coincidence.</a>

In this email, I alerted them to the serious dysfunctions of the French judicial system. I also provided 7 concrete examples of the serious crime of falsification/doctoring/altering/forging of a court/public/official/legal document/decision, under articles 441-1 and 441-4 of the French criminal code. I alerted them that there are at least several billion euros in fines to be imposed on the McDonald&#39;s group.</a>

This office had intentionally altered a date to unjustly dismiss my appeal against McDonald&#39;s France and one of their accomplices, thus committing a serious crime under French law. Minister Belloubet might also have committed a crime if she neglected to follow-up on my report.</a>

This office had intentionally altered a date to unjustly dismiss my appeal against McDonald&#39;s France and one of their accomplices.</a>

            <a href="https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/law-professor-yves-strickler-states-that-the-adversarial-procedure-is-the-only-rule-to-guarantee/"><span style="color: red">January 3, 2018</span> French Law Professor Yves Strickler tells me that the adversarial procedure is fundamentally the only rule to guarantee.

That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it. In essence, this situation amounts to the judicial branch circumventing the legislative branch to create its own laws, a practice that is profoundly dangerous. It undermines the principle of the separation of powers, a cornerstone of democratic governance.</a>
