      <description>This page hasn’t been updated for a long time and I invite to read instead the current draft of the continously updated crime report targeting McDonald’s Corporation and its accomplices: https://www.ecthrwatch.org/timeline/latest-crime-report-criminal-rico-case-targeting-mcdonalds/

I sent to New York Times journalist Constant Méheut a very good explanation regarding the 1 chance out of 4 fraud. He agreed that it was fraud. You can read the demonstration by following this link:

Multiple countries across the world and over the years have been affected by this specific type of serious fraud.</description>
