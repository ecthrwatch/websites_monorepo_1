      <description>Key takeaway: McDonald’s Corporation and its executives knew perfectly well, in 2015, that McDonald’s Corporation and its subsidiary companies were engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.
“MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
MATTHEW F. KENNELLY, United States District Judge.
[…]
McDonald&amp;rsquo;s asserts seven claims against the defendants. Counts 1 and 2 are claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against Jacobson and the other individual defendants, charging them with conducting Simon&amp;rsquo;s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiring to do so.</description>
