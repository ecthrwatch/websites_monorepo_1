Dear Ms. Ralls-Morrison,
I recently came across a LinkedIn post announcing your upcoming receipt of the CCWC 2024 Diamond Award of Excellence in Las Vegas at the Bellagio, as quoted by Ms. Laurie N. Robinson Haden. While many have extended their congratulations, I find myself in a position of contemplation rather than celebration.</description>

Dear Minister,
I sent you a request last week. I implore you, please give me an answer, even if it&amp;rsquo;s negative. But please say something.
I understand that you must be very busy. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to respond to me personally. You can delegate this matter to someone else. But please have someone contact me by email quickly.</description>

Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2017-07-04_1733_0800_yves_strickler.pdf Email from Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, confirming to me that procedural contracts are invented by the French bar associations, French jurisdictions, and French legal aid offices (BAJ - Bureaux d&amp;rsquo;Aide Juridictionnelle), and that this is something truly preposterous! That the law is the law, and French institutions are obligated to respect it.</description>

Click on this link to visualize the original email: 2017-07-04_0142_0800_reply_from_law_professor_yves_strickler.pdf I had written to Professor Yves Strickler, Associate Professor of Law Faculties, to ask him if, in his opinion, my request for provisional admission to legal aid was admissible. He confirms that my request for provisional admission to legal aid appears to be admissible. Moreover, he is surprised that I have not initiated summary proceedings in my employment case in which I was dismissed in 2010 for striking.</description>
