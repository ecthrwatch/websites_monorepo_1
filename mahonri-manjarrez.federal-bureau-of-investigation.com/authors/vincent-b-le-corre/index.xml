Subject: Mr. Rogalski, I want to help you understand one of the biggest fraud in history
Date sent: February 7, 2023 at 13:34 +0800 (China Standard Time)
To: Adam Rogalski (Legal Attaché/State Department)
Cc: Edward Lehman
Note: since Assistant Legal Attaché Adam Rogalski told me on 2021-09-20 that he was “one of the FBI representatives,” I assume that this communication was transfered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</description>

Subject: Forgery and use of forged documents at the Legal Aid Office of the Versailles Court?
Date sent: October 23, 2018, at 20:06 +0800 (China Standard Time)
To: Nicole Belloubet
On October 23, 2018, at 20:06, I formally notified French Minister of Justice Nicole Belloubet about the grave incident at the Legal Aid Office of the Versailles Court. This office had intentionally altered a date to unjustly dismiss my appeal against McDonald&amp;rsquo;s France and one of their accomplices, thus committing a serious crime under French law.</description>
